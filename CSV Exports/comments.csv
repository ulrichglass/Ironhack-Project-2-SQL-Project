This will make you stand out- PLEASE never stop learning, during, and even after the course. Be curious and try to learn as much as you can by yourself. Just the course is not going to make you land the job or a pro.

They don't even take effort to find out tasks, you have to do them.Price:Learning portals: 10/10 , from free, super cheapIronhack: 2/10, 7000$, can be much, much more at other bootcamp schoolsTeacher knowledge:Learning portals: 10/10, the greatest minds are sharing their knowledge.Ironhack 3/10: They definately are not stupid.

With bootcamps you pay thousands of dollars with no hope of a refund if its shit.TLDR: Overall experience:I'm not sure what I expected from this, I was new to the field and wanted to jump in somehow, just learning a few hours every now and then was not really effective. So in a way it was good, because I spent the time on learning, not on playing games etc. Also i did not have to work during the 10 week with full salary because of covid. So i only regret it halfsy.Don't do any bootcamps if you can sit down by yourself to study/read stuff. The only reason to pick a bootcamp is because you can't get yourself to sit down and learn. If you can, online learning is the way.Oh i almost forgot: Teachers, TAs and job supporters were many times late and cancelling appointments(during full lockdown, they were working from home but cancelled the hours!!)Read Less",ironhack

After all that grinding, you are able to produce 3 awesome projects (which you will be very proud of). However, your overall grasp on web development is still pretty shallow so be prepared to continue learning and deepening your knowledge even after graduation. This bootcamp is a great starting point! And lastly, 3. Even though this class is remote and invites students from anywhere, it is still focused towards South Florida particularly during Career Week where they help you search for jobs and prep you for interviews. Although they do teach you how to search for jobs (with this skill it's applicable to wherever you are), but many of their references to jobs, companies, connections, speakers, fast track interviews matchmaking system, etc. are all Florida-based, so people who don't live there may feel excluded. The career department for all USA students is a one man show - Granted he is very knowledgeable and has much wisdom to offer, but I hope Ironhack hires more people to support in this area as the graduates' career needs are surely growing and beyond the limits of just one person.Overall, the experience was good, the instructors were GREAT, I cried, I laughed, I learned a lot, and it's worth the money.Read Less",ironhack

Read More only study with them for 2 months - you will remember and know for the rest of your life. I am writing this review 2 years after finishing my bootcamp. One of the things I remember reading about (which I kind of doubted before starting) was the friendship everyone said you develop with co-participants, and how tight you become as a group. I was proven wrong. The Ironhack staff of Berlin almost forced us to become good friends! Now now, hear me out. After a first day of introduction games, name games and an already overwhelming amount of work, the participants would go out together and have a drink. And after a hard day's work (and on every Friday!) we would do the same. We had pair-programming everyday during classes and did independent projects in pairs or trios. The work is so intense, and you spend so much time with your peers, that by the time the first week is over, it will feel like you've already known the others for a long time. You end up with a sort of "us against the work"-mentality because of the sheer amount, where you just have to band together to beat the monster that is the Daily Exercise. I feel that I don't really need to say much about the effectiveness of Ironhack's teaching. I got a job after 1 month. I had zero prior coding skills, or even math skills, just an interest for gaming and technology. Most of my cohort got a job in way less time, many even before the camp ended. I got to be a help teacher after my bootcamp and can give a few tips, as some of the difficulties students had were similar in the next group. - Read up and get as good as you can before the bootcamp. I was not particularly well prepared (I would say average to below average skill level), and had to work that much more. Don't do what I did. Don't procrastinate the pre-work. The workload is massive, and "getting back on track" when you start off-track is really, really hard. - Additionally, go out with the other participants! Get a beer (or ten)! Switch places in the classroom! Say yes to all the outings and beers and lunches and whatnot. Remember that when you're done there, your skill level is only one part of the picture. Your network and friendships are the stuff you actually remember. And practially speaking, I now have multiple contacts within the tech industry from all around the world. So make it a good experience by having fun, and not drowning in the work, and it's a win-win.- Take some distance. Take at least one day off per week. Don't "use the weekend to get back on track" (you will say this at some point). You will need the time off in the long run, just trust me on that.Read Less",ironhack

I was dismayed to find... Read More out that the course teacher used to previously teach coding at a different academy. Because of this, we got zero intro on even the basics of UI, other than a vague introduction to color theory. There was only a passing mention of material design and design systems. Now I work as a UI UX designer, after 6 months of trying to find a job. I work solely on UI, which is what any entry level designer will be expected to do. During the course, we also focused on learning to code, which- sure was useful but did not need to be a priority in the short 2 month course. A lot of the coding teaching was done by the TA, who was quite a nice person but definitely not suited for teaching. Which bring me to how Ironhack also pumps up its employment percentage. It employs its students from previous courses as its TAs. This is unfair, I would hope that TAs would atleast have a 1year experience as a UI UX designer. Overall, its a fun environment and I made some great friends. In terms of learning, I did most of it myself after I graduated.

I enrolled myself on the full time web development bootcamp. It was a lot of hard work , a lot of homework, a lot of things to learn in so short time, and a lot of code to submit that same night. Very little hours... Read More of sleep and usually thinking and dreaming about code.My story started with company lay-off, so I was unemployed looking for job and counting my money and looking for a way to make it last, a friend of mine recommended me IronHack, "you could change carriers as I did" , that sounded good ! and at least it could be an attractive boost to my current skills. I was having doubts but the day I payed the bootcamp a visit they talk me about some financing options, so I took some days to do my budget and gave it a green light, I enrolled in the next FT bootcamp. As I mentioned early, it was hard and challenging, if you have zero coding background (math is not that important) you better enroll in the part time bootcamp, if you had some coding subjects in school you just need to apply (a lot) yourself, if you know how to code but you want to learn fast and with help the bootcamp stack then it is a very good jump start for learning the language and the tools. Maybe you come from a different background that is not technology, if that is your case consider first the halftime bootcamp because it can get frustrating how little time you have and how many things you got to learn and how complex are the projects you have to deliver. My lead teachers were very good, very young (considering the average of my career teachers) but they were awesome coders and dedicated about teaching , sometimes a little cocky; my teacher assistants were good maybe sometimes hard to find or not as crafty as one would like, they were always well intentioned even the times the fix they gave you crashed your code, but every bootcamp has different teachers and assistants so only fortune can tell who your teachers are going to be. One thing I can tell you, yes the program will include the most fitted technologies to go and search for a job and enough knowledge to get you started as an entry level programmer, depending on how easy if for you to build upon those skills is who much more you can achieve in your job search, the other skills that you learned before also add up to that. In few words my bootcamp experience was very good,just remember, you need to be up to the task. About my job quest and job support experience, I can tell you that my job support has been very good, very unique times (covid pandemic) to be looking for job, I notice that the technology market keeps growing and keeps hiring people at least more than the other markets,some of them  are shrinking or paused, so I cannot tell at this moment if the same rules of the year before apply to my future job and salary offers, but I'm glad the Tech and coding market is still hiring and growing. It is a great and outstanding work and support the one being made by the "hiring support team" I can tell that it makes a difference in your favor to have them, ( I notice because I pass many months looking for job by myself before the bootcamp), so it is awesome to have them once you finish the bootcamp, It is not a walk in the park, it is still demanding looking for a job but the burden is less. Is it worth it ? well, short answer YES, is not cheap ( try looking for a scholarship or financing help); the end is just the beginning, as you finish the bootcamp you notice that there are SO many different technologies, tools and languages out there that it gets a little overwhelming, so look into the things you like and apply yourself on learning those new things you want or need.I have many thing to tell but I think these word are good enough to give you an idea of the experience. Best of luck if you choose this path.Read Less",ironhack

It worked. In nine weeks I won't have the pretention to say "Yeah I'm totally a fullstack dev" but I coded three projects, the last wining an award from my school. I'm now able to start coding my own things, and I discovered something I love and want to work in.The teaching team has been very supporting from start to finish, I made good friends even if I was expecting a 9 to 6 gig, and I really liked the general atmosphere put in place to make everyone feel at home. Before finishing my bootcamp, I've been offered a TA position for the next sessions, and the chance to help others have the same experience I had, and challenging myself into debugging students on problems I was struggling with a few weeks before was very tempting : I said yes. They've been very reactive when the lockdown took set in France, and we're now running the session in remote, we maintained the friendly atmosphere and we give everything to make our students feel the same support and mentoring as if they were physically in the classroom. Javascript all the way (Node and React) are stacks that get you hired, that's what we teach.I would like to stick around for a while, and find a position in a company, and why not launch myself as a freelance in a year or two ! Career wise, we're coached every step of the way : workshops, support, custom path tracking, and goals setting. Even remotely, they reach out to us and make sure we have the best tools / clues as to where / how to get the job we want, and that's a big plus that wasn't on the "brochure" of every bootcamp.I would totally recommend this school to people who are not afraid to work hard, sweat and challenge themselves. It's hard, it's intense, it's very fast but if you really play by the rules and put yourself out there, I truly believe it works.Read Less",ironhack

I.e. with new furniture, branding, ping pong table and so much more.- External speakers and UI workshop were a big thing.Cons:- In the beginning their were certain things that did not go well. Small things for instance the online material was a bit different from the class material. Or some supplies were not always restocked. However, we had a retrospective after each project. The teacher would use our feedback and make sure those things and more were improved.- Corona virus. Our final project had to take place online.

This decision turned out to be an amazing add on to my existing set of skills and made me a much better engineer.Experience summary:- High workload;- High complexity on the topics;- So many new and useful things learned!- Machine Learning module is awesome, but short.- Very competent teaching staff;- Super responsible and caring administrative staff;- Cool extra seminars along the bootcamp, for example: Build an ETL Pipeline, Build a Django App;- Beer and pizza offered by IronHack on events! :)Detailed experience:The program is very well distributed. The first weeks were mainly dedicated to learn basic programming and to clean data in Python. Since, data cleaning is such an important feature on a Data Scientist, the program has a very intensive approach on this subject (Very cool and useful!). We also spent a few days learning SQL, which is great, because it gives you a feel of the data warehousing task. Then, we learned how to manipulate data and make it 'readable' for everyone, using super interesting data visualization libraries and software. At this point, we were only at the first part of the bootcamp. The workload was really high and the tasks were not easy, but I was learning so much! I thought it couldn't get more difficult, but then, second part of the bootcamp came on...After this point not only the workload increased, but the complexity of the subjects studied also increased! We started going deep on Statistics. This was a very challenging and important part of the bootcamp, since Statistics are one of the stepping stones of Data Analytics. The last weeks were dedicated to the coolest topic (in my opinion) - Machine Learning! We got to learn multiple algorithms and techniques to develop prediction projects. In the last project on campus (2 weeks project), we had to develop a Machine Learning Model and present our results. I was really happy and excited on the last weeks, cause I got to see and feel the potential of an amazing technology like Machine Learning. However, I got the feeling that we needed to dedicate more time on the Machine Learning module. The program should be reviewed in the sense that it should dedicate more time to study Deep Learning. The teaching staff was very competent! We had 4 teachers available - 1 lead teacher and 3 assistant teachers. They were really good educating and there was always someone available to help. Very effective teaching system!Besides the technical characteristics and the teaching staff of the program, I also feel that is important to refer that the administrative IronHack staff was really amazing with me.

I will try to be as honest as possible. Before the course starts, students must complete prework assignments based off an online learning platform.... Read More The platform was a good start but didn’t always provide all necessary information or enough examples to completely understand the material. The TAs are available to help, but in my experience they didn’t always get back to me right away (I later learned why—the TAs are extremely overworked). The prework needs improving because there’s no good way to accurately see if you’ve learned enough before the course starts, even by completing the two assignments. As for the course itself: class was from 9-18:00 but if you’re taking it seriously, you’ll stay several extra hours to complete the lab assignments. It’s lots of self-learning. The website is accurate in its structure of the day, with lectures and labs interspersed. They’re good at giving you lots of breaks, which you’ll need. The TAs are amazing and work hard to help you, sometimes sitting down for long periods of time to debug your code. Personally I think they did more than the teacher and deserve more pay/credit. On the other hand, the fact that TAs can help you whenever and assignments are often done with partners, it’s hard to know if you truly understand the material. You might be completing assignments after receiving help from others, so it’s hard to gauge whether you’ve comprehended it all. Personally I felt like my TAs coded my entire project because I didn’t understand any of it, while the feedback from the TAs was very positive. I therefore felt there was a huge discrepancy because they couldn’t truly see how people were doing. When I tried to advocate for myself, they always just told me I was fine. The projects overall are a great way to break into a new career. You’ll learn a lot and add to your portfolio. Additionally, you’ll do 1/2 daily labs, mini projects, so you’ll build up a good foundation. After the bootcamp I think learning online would be impossible. IH barely scratches the surface, and to learn the same amount without a bootcamp would take years, especially without help from peers. On the other hand, I personally think IH isn’t the right bootcamp anymore. Perhaps it once was, but its career services leave something to be desired (in the case of my class: a career). Our hiring week took place right before Christmas, so it might as well not have happened, as no one hires then anyway. After that, we received only a couple emails within the three months after graduating, not nearly enough compared to the services promised. They also weren’t overly available for meetings so scheduling usually wasn’t instantaneous, and my meetings were short and seemingly unproductive. They told me things I already know. More frustrating is the fact that of all the people in my class looking for a new job, only a small number got hired within those three months, probably well below a 50% hiring rate, or even 30%. Overall, a bootcamp may or may not be a good decision, but for the financial and physical and mental health costs, IH is not the best choice.Read Less",ironhack

It is important to notice here than Ironhack has many locations and for sure there is a lot of differences between them - actually... Read More it's hard to find them about this specific course in Berlin, so this is why I decided to write my opinion here.Maybe I will start from positive part here. The working environment it's really amazing, mostly due to the people who participate in the course. It's really great to work with people with different skills and with various background - everyone was very supportive, kind and helpful. When you are stuck with anything, you can always count on your classmates. Also, I think the curriculum is well constructed and contains the most important information - of course, it's super intense and it's not possible to remember everything from the lectures but you will get a forever access to the learning platform - pretty helpful. The cool building, comfortable chairs and the free barista were also big advantages :)Before joining the course, I studied carefully the info and details on their websites. For sure, Ironhack promises a lot and it's not suprising, beacuse the bootcamps are very expensive (and getting even more). I would like to refer here to some of their promises.First of all the, the group was bigger than they promised, and way bigger than in the different locations. I was counting for a small group and pair work experience, instead it was more like back-to-school and 4 people in the group way of working - way too much.First of all, the lead teacher is not a UX/UI designer, but a visual designer, and actually he is not even really interested in the UX part and as he admitted, he has never really worked with it. I expected him to have a broad knowledge about UX, but it was pretty limited to the slides he was presenting. Also, he was very hardly accessible - he was usually leaving early or were always busy with something else. To be honest, he didn't seem really interested in the job.Ironhack presents itself as a team "tech spec" - but a lot of times they are just lacking skills. The teacher and TA are definitely not specialist in the softwares that are used during the course - it's very disappointing. During the career week, some invited people to the school seemed pretty random - maybe just to fill our time with something? I'm not sure if inviting a person who is an ex-TA who doesn't have a job yet as an "interview specialist" or doing negotiation workshops with a person who has no experience with it is the best idea... I think Ironhack should really take closer look at the people who they are hiring - both the teacher and TAs seem often unmotivated and not really engaged in their work. I understand they are not professional designers but sometimes their advice and knowledge is lower that the participants of the course. And also, complaining about students in the common areas, where everyone can hear it, is VERY unprofessional.Overall, I learned a lot during the course, but it was a lot of my individual work I put in it and also from people I ask for advice from - unfortunately I can't say the staff was really helpful. I think that Ironhack is not a bad school, but for this price, people's expectations were way higher, what almost everyone admitted at the end. At the moment, I'd advice to think twice before joining campus in Berlin and maybe to consider different locations.Read Less",ironhack

You will have classes imparted by a teacher where you will have fun from start to finish, it might be rough, it might be tough but its always fun. I went by this curriculum and it actually help me understand coding and gave me great foundations on how to study and learn new technologies. I still go about learning new technologies the same way I did at Ironhack. If you follow this curriculum(understanding it, reading it before class and then solving every doubt you have during classes) and finish EVERY part of it(even the "extras") you will leave Ironhack knowing enough to get hired anywhere.Instructors: My teacher was Nick Borbe, my TAs were Marcos Palacios and Manuel Cabrera. Everyone was great, super helpful and knowledgeable. If at any point they did not know the answer to something you asked they would look into it and comeback with the answer. Great people all around. Job Assistance: Ironhack is the best, and that's in no small part thanks to Daniel Brito, this guy will find you a job. He won't hold your hand during the process but if he sees you putting in 200% he will put in 300%. Make use of him, ask him questions, show him you are interested and he will help you. Overall: As with any other course or any type of education process you will get back what you put in. If this is really what you want I can't think of a better place to learn the basics of coding/programming/web develpment than at Ironhack. They helped me change my life for the better, I'm finally happy with what I do and actually miss work when I'm on vacation. All of this started with Ironhack and I will never forget it.If you are still undecided I invite you to add me on linkedin and ask me any question about Ironhack and my experience there, I'll be more than happy to answer.Read Less",ironhack

Read More held the position for a couple of weeks and then this spot was filled by a number of temporary replacements. This didn’t allow me to get very close to any of those people and it felt like a resource that I expected to have wasn’t really available that cohort. In the end, we turned to fellow classmates for supplemental help most of all and this teamwork really helped many of us. The course is very intense and incoming students should expect to be stressed out by the workload. A lot of information is packed into a few months, so it’s important to bookmark all of the important websites your teacher shows you and of course to take good notes! If you have past work experience that relates at all to the duties of a UX/UI designer or even if you just had a strong interest in parts of the process, this will come in handy! I’d always had an interest in art and had done some graphic design before. On the other hand, if you have zero relevant experience and were interested in completing this course, I would say to be patient and realistic about where your skills might be by graduation time. While I do think Ironhack can give you a boost and help you get started with your new career, I saw some classmates struggle with creating professional-looking visual designs- even by the end of the course. So if you’re doing something difficult for the first time, don’t expect a miracle. That said… coding week was not great for me. Most of the other students had had at least a little bit of exposure to coding before the course, so they were able to keep up with the instructor. A few students (including me) had never had any exposure and we fell behind and could never catch up. I was repeatedly told that it was ok if I knew nothing about coding, but it felt like a little more understanding was necessary to understand the fast-talking teacher I had for coding week. Daniel Brito was my career coach while I was there and I really appreciated his support. He gave me a lot of awesome advice and helped me see things from the perspective of the employer. Although he was busy assisting lots of students, he did a good job of dividing up his time and giving me his full attention when it was my turn. In the end, I walked away with a portfolio that helped me get my current job, so it was worth it for me! Plus it’s nice to be part of the Ironhack network.Read Less",ironhack

Read More Turns out, I already had a solid enough background that I likely needed a step up from what Ironhack had to offer. That said, I think the program is great for the right audience– people who are looking to change careers or don't have a background in design or creative problem solving at all whatsoever. The pros:- The curriculum is ever-changing with the times and the Ironhack staff did a good job making course corrections as our cohort went on.- It's a great base for anyone looking to learn UX/UI as a new skill/career path.- The class size is pretty small and the relationships forged are great for post-graduation.- We had a number of opportunities to network with past alumni and hear about what/how they're doing now.The cons:- Execution of the curriculum felt a bit disjointed and disorganized. We did too many super short projects to be able to really dig deep and learn any nuances.- The coding week was a disaster– it was entirely unplanned and we didn't get additional resources until three days into the week. At $1000+/week, 3 wasted days is not cheap.- This may not be a con to everyone, but the program and the Ironhack staff were a bit too chill for me. There were a lot of rules that they really drove home at the beginning... but never followed through on. The execution was lacking and we ended up being treated like both children and adults simultaneously.- We were promised things repeatedly that we never received. (For example, we were supposed to have professional headshots taken, but the photographer was a no-show and the staff chose not to reschedule for us. Our headshots were taken on an iPhone. Again– at $12k/person, we should be able to reschedule a photographer.) A lot of little things like that added up to a negative experience.For my situation personally, I made the best decision I could with the information I had.

He preps you on how to land a great job, he teaches you how to speak and reach out to companies and make yourself known. I applied many of his tactics and it helped me improve and build a reputation for myself in another city. Overall this school is great. Its not too expensive and it way more worth it than getting in debt for some other expensive school that might not even be worth it. If I could take this course again, I would, BUT unfortunately I am employed.Read Less",ironhack

In general Nico was great person who was easy talk to and made you feel comfortable throughout the learning process.The curriculum itself is well thought-out and constantly changing. You really feel you are learning whatever technology is the most relevant.

The sense of camaraderie is strong and It feels good to be in deep with the your fellow classmates. We all worked hard together, helped each other out and bonded over struggling with the same difficult sections.Thankfully Ironhack was good about making sure there are some unwinding opportunities. Lisa and Jess did an excellent job of keeping the energy up and organizing much needed stress relief moments that gave everyone an opportunity to unplug, eat some pizza and drink a little beer (or kombucha).Finally Brito is there to make sure we stayed focused on the reason most of us joined the course: To get jobs! Brito helped us prioritize what's important in terms of our future careers. He has tons of extremely useful experience in terms of what companies are looking for when hiring talent. He makes us looks good and gives us pro tips on building out resumes and our Linkedins. Brito also does an excellent job bringing in tech veterans to share their knowledge with us. We've had speakers talk to us about the hiring process, the tech world, problems we may face, and even set up mock technical and soft skill interviews. If you have a specific interest in something in particular Brito will connect you with someone from his MASSIVE and beautifully organized list of tech contacts and Ironhack alum. Brito works very hard and is constantly finding new opportunities for graduates to pursue.Prior to Ironhack I was exhausting myself working as a cook and making next to nothing. As someone who is now happily working as a web developer, signing up for Ironhack was one of the smartest moves I've ever made.

I was busy getting my development environment set up for my new job as we were trying to finish our final projects. Needless to say it was rewarding. Tiring, but rewarding. My teacher was new to teaching so I will give him a lot of slack for understanding, teaching style, preparation and professionalism. Being able to self-teach and research documentation are both important skills so learning that is critical anyhow. I’m all about self improvement and learning new skills but when it comes down to it, it’s about getting work. Ironhack delivered. As a note: The hiring network tends to be local to the school so choose a location in a market that you want to work in. The career fair that Brito put together was unbelievable. There was a feeding-frenzy of local companies (20+) looking to hire in a well orchestrated event. The companies ranged the gamut from Citrix and Royal Caribbean to small startups. Ironhack campuses are all over the world so there is bound to be a place for you to enjoy, while you get your foot in the door of the dev world. Once you get your first dvelopment job it is much easier to find another position that is in another market. Bottom line, if you do your best, know how to learn and stay focused you will both enjoy your time and end up getting work. I want to thank the whole Ironhack team and also want to thank Brito personally. He was a pleasure to work with and a HUGE help!!!Read Less",ironhack

Also the technical stack is modern and highly valuable in the job market; you learn JavaScript and then use it in the backend and in the frontend; I think it's a smart choice and you can have so much more practice using always the same language.If I had to highlight just one aspect of the bootcamp, it would be working on the 3 projects with other students: it really helped shaping us as developers and working with people with so diverse backgrounds - but with the same objective in life - was the greatest learning and working experience I've ever had.Thanks to the topics covered during classes, which were always engaging and featuring what you really need to know, we were able to progress really quickly. The instructors and teaching assistants were extremely helpful and they always strove to make everything as smooth as possible for all the students.Pair programming and exercises were a daily task and they allowed us to discover many topics and real life workflows in software development.However a lot of effort is required to stay on track: only passion and commitment will drive you through the 9 weeks, so be sure about your objectives and dreams. If it checks for you, then you'll be a perfect match.Also the career services were a great asset to me: I have learnt all you need in order to find the right job. We met several professionals in the sector during the whole course and the hiring fair was a blast! We met 14 companies (and some of us were hired by these very companies) in 2 days and it was the best training I could have asked for all the following interviews.However I think that the course materials (written lessons and exercises) still need some improvement: as technologies evolve so quickly, it's hard to keep all the materials up to date.

Also a major revision of the contents is in progress, so I wouldn't worry too much about it.

I did a lot of research, soul-searching, and self-teaching prior to the program. In general, I had a positive experience with the program, but it has its share of pros and cons, and would benefit... Read More some more than others.One of the best parts of the program is the classroom/workshop setting. It was challenging to make much progress learning on my own despite having several friends who are already experienced UX designers. The opportunity to connect with others who are also looking to break into the field, share ideas and learnings with them, and build a portfolio alongside them, was invaluable. The other is the job placement support. At the end of the program, students are able to attend a hiring fair, which is like speed-dating with companies for jobs. That in itself is an amazing opportunity for new designers. Additionally, the outcomes manager, Brito, is a fantastic resource. He is well-connected in the industry within South Florida and readily available to provide guidance with your job search. That said, if you aren't looking for a job in South Florida, then I'm not so sure that Ironhack Miami would be the best program for you -- I would definitely recommend a program that is local to wherever you want to begin your career.I also really appreciated the instructor, David Fast. He is super knowledgeable and a great mentor. I always got tons of insight whenever I had a 1:1 with him. However, even in my class of only 11 students, this was a rare and often rushed occurrence. In one instance, I was scheduled to meet with David last, and then my meeting never happened. I wished the program were better structured to allow all students an equal opportunity to meet with their instructor regularly.We also had a high churnover of TAs, and some were more helpful than others.The curriculum could also be improved. It was very high-level and theoretical -- a lot of content that we could have easily read about on our own. Sometimes we just watched a YouTube video in class -- it boggles me that I am paying tuition, commuting to class, and spending class time to watch something I could have streamed at home. I'd rather class time be spent on learning "tricks of the trade", things that would boost our skills and portfolio, things that we could readily transfer to the workplace. Not things that I could easily Google or watch on YouTube.The program manager, Jessica, is super personable and resourceful. I appreciated her effort to provide opportunities for us to work with real companies for our final project. Although I was very excited by the idea, ultimately I passed on the opportunity because the options available were limited and did not align with my learning or portfolio goals. I know that some of my classmates had less than positive experiences working with these companies as well. I think this is one area where, if improved, could make or break my recommendation of the program to others.Finally, I don't think this program is for everyone. I think either the interview process or the pre-work or both could be a bit more rigorous to set the right expectations. As an example, if you were to ask the Web Dev students why they enrolled in their program, 99% of the time they would say it's because they love coding. But if you asked the UX students the same question, you rarely hear that it's because they love design or product. I think Ironhack could better screen prospective students and help them be sure that this is the right step for them. I hope this review helps and provides some food for thought!Read Less",ironhack

In short: very dedicated teachers, tons of support, weekly feedback surveys (where they actually take your feedback into account!), and lots of perks like networking and informational events, free... Read More beer, coffee, AWESOME people, etc. What I came in with:My background is in Linguistics and Media Design (graphic and web design), and I decided to expand on my web design skills by actually learning how to build websites. I'd had a little experience coding in HTML and CSS before I started the course, but had no programming experience and only a little knowledge of how the internet works. The bootcamp really kicked my butt!! It felt the entire time that I was not keeping up as much as I'd have liked even though I was spending every waking hour learning as much as I could (i.e.: reviewing on the trains to and from the course, staying late to finish exercises, learning on the weekends...). I found that this was a pretty common feeling for a lot of people in the course, so you build great connections and help each other along the way. It was also essential that the teachers were so dedicated and supportive. It was my first introduction to how social coding could and should be.In the end, even though a lot of the content was over my head throughout the course, I found that I'd learned enough to land the software developer job I'd had my eyes on since before the bootcamp. I'll be working in various languages, so showing my newly-gained knowledge of Javascript was enough to prove that I will be able to learn and work in other programming languages as well. Advice for anyone starting the course (especially if you have no programming experience like me!): Do yourself a favour and spend as much time as possible with the pre-work! I wish I'd spent more time with the Javascript part, it ended up being harder than I'd expected to wrap my head around the basics and I kind of ran out of time before the course started. I'd recommend even supplementing the pre-work with tutorials so that you really have a good grasp of the basics that are introduced there. There are lots of great tutorials online, free and paid, I learn really well with teamtreehouse.com for example.It's been said a lot already, but it's totally true: work hard, don't give up, trust the process, and stay curious. It's ok to feel dumb, I promise! I did for most of the course and still got the job I wanted. You can totally do it!!Read Less",ironhack

I had an AMAZING experience with Ironhack Miami. To give you an idea of how the class is structured, Week 1 and 2: FRONTEND: learn JS, HTML, CSS, jQuery,... Read More DOM Manipulation, Canvas. Week 3: Use those skills to create a game application, present at end of the week. Week 4 and 5: BACKEND: learn Node.js and Express, amongst numerous other topics. Week 6: Use those skills to create a full-stack application, present at the end of the week. Week 7: Learn React.js. Week 8 and 9: Create a Full-Stack MERN application, present at the end of Week 9. All non-project weeks are pretty much structured the same: Topic 1 lecture in the morning, then a paired lab. Topic 2 lecture in the afternoon, then a solo lab. The class was structured to have one lead instructor and 2 TAs. While this might sound similar to other bootcamps you've researched, I would like to point out the "stand outs" that make Ironhack Miami unique, which are the reasons why I ultimately chose it instead of other bootcamps I looked at:1. Career Services: I can pretty much guarantee you will not find another bootcamp with a Career Services Manager like Daniel Brito. Not only is he incredibly well connected and great at creating partnerships with the school and local companies, but he is SO resourceful and involved. He typically lectured once a week to the class for an hour, and once you graduate the meetings get more frequent and more specialized to each student and their current job situation. I've been a working professional for 10 years and Brito still had great LinkedIn, Resume and Career advise to offer that I had never heard. While Brito is not the ONLY benefit to joining Ironhack, he is the most impactful benefit, hands down.2. Pre-Work: This was the second most beneficial part of Ironhack for me. Other bootcamps I looked at did not require pre-work, but this was by far the difference that made me not completely lost when I started school. While the pre-work was VERY hard for me, as I was a career changer and not used to the terminology, the technologies or anything, the pre-work was SO helpful because it . forced me to familiarize myself with all of this BEFORE class started. If there had no been . pre-work, I don't think I would have been nearly as successful in the class as I was.3. Building.co: this is the building Ironhack is located in. Some great features to note about it that were super helpful being a student- 24 hour access to the building, via secured access, unlimited free granola bars, unlimited free coffee (of ANY type), unlimited beer on draft starting at 5 PM, cool kitchen/outdoor space with picnic tables and corn hole to relax and take breaks. Building.co is a co-working space so there are a lot of tech people who have desks there to work, which is ideal for networking as a tech student. 4. Guest speakers: tech speakers were brought in typically once every 2 weeks to talk to the class. This was helpful for networking purposes, but also for insight into the industry, what people do, what they are looking for, etc.5. Lisa - the Growth Manger, was always great about hosting industry events at Building.co and in the area for students to attend with Miami tech industry people. This, again, was great for networking and more exposure to the industry.6. The curriculum was well thought out and offers a lot of resources for you to have outside of class. If you pay attention in class, then go back and read all of the lectures, you will get the most benefits. Now that I am out of school and interviewing, I realize how many of the interview questions/vocab were in our lesson plans, I just never read them during class. READ THE LECTURES!!! They are super helpful!!7. Lastly, the overall atmosphere created by the Ironhack Team is truly incredible. It is such a family/friend atmosphere where you work super hard, pull intense all nighters, but there is a sense of "we are in this together" and "we are here for you" which makes the whole process more fun and enjoyable.Read Less",ironhack

(usually the TA's are former students that didn't find a job and start working with Ironhack while looking for more opportunities; Pretty awesome help, feels like a safety net for some people).The Curriculum is packed with huge amounts of information and you need to apply yourself to learn more everyday.

The bootcamp helped me solidify my UX/UI skills &amp; interests while giving me the platform (and confidence) to pursue UX/UI design in a more than successful manner. Most importantly, the culture that they provided (from admin to instructors to TA) was an invaluable asset to the entire experience. I thought some reviews were corny when they mentioned a "family-like vibe" before I entered the course, but no joke, it organically came about that way and was the magic to the whole thing. I've met some truly special people and developed meaningful connections.I felt a little lost in what I wanted to do before I came in to the course (having exhausted all kind of jobs in all kinds of industries) and always felt stuck in my potential, but the bootcamp changed my life and gave me back my confidence in my personal &amp; professional skills while giving me the networks &amp; resources needed to really pursue a career and not just a job. It was intense, but so worth every penny &amp; minute spent. Also keep in mind that the course is here to help you, NOT do it all for you. This is an important read: bit.ly/ironhackuxuiPros:- Instructor (X1000): Nevan made the entire difference because of his experience &amp; character. The material was so digestible and interesting. His direction &amp; guidance was priceless.- Teacher assistants: telling of the course &amp; instructor to have these individuals as the TA. They were relatable, but still way more knowledgeable to help us along the way- constant events: Ironhack constantly holds professional events, grabbing the industry and its networks in through the doors. The topics are always relevant &amp; networking it great- material &amp; projects: what can I say? I'm super proud to have the projects on my portfolio and have received delightful feedback from industry professionals on the scope of the project - tuition well spent (investing back in the students): You're always going to feel like you're spending a lot on whichever bootcamp you sign up for, but I always felt like I got more than what I expected. They often will have events that have free snacks &amp; beverages (free filtered water!!!) for the students and you can tell that part of the tuition is really kept for the students- friendly atmosphere: any staff member is always helpful &amp; cheery. It was never stiff walking into the office or talking to at admin staff- location: you're in the center of the tech neighborhoods (10 min walk away from the tech hub in BCN) and in the middle of really great coffee shopsCons:- some students got lazy towards the end which was a bit distracting but not really Ironhack's fault- can't think of anything elseRead Less",ironhack

Read More and ran into Ironhack and decided to dive in and take it’s Full-Time Web Dev course after coming across great reviews/ratings.Expectations and Course Run DownBe ready to learn, because you’re going to learn a lot. It's a full time 9-5pm every day for 9 weeks (not including the after hours you want to put in as well) it's no joke so just prepare to fully invest the next 9 weeks into IronHack. You learn for 2 weeks and then immediately are sent off to create a project within a week - repeat again 2 more times after that. Come in prepared to learn, take in all the material, and be willing to put in the work.Help During Course Work / Curriculum (TA’s and Teacher)The instructor for our Cohort (Nick) was very knowledgeable. The only downside was that it was his first time teaching the course, so it felt like he was also learning as we were all trying to learn something too. Besides that, he was most definitely a great instructor and without his proficiency on the subject, I would not have learned as much as I did. As for the teaching assistants, all three of them were amazing (Sandra, Marcos, Ian). They were all very familiar with the coursework since they were all Ironhack graduates as well. It was extremely helpful having dedicated TA's who were former students helping us because they know the struggle so they WANT to help. There's more than enough help to go around, just make sure to ASK for it when you need it and you won't fall behind.The coursework definitely needed some tweaking on some days, our instructor Nick pushed aside what he felt was wrong and obsolete and taught it the best way he could and it definitely worked out. During the course this was one of my top issues, the curriculum for sure needed an update, but from what I have seen after my time there they are (or already have) taken the steps necessary to do so. Which means they take your feedback seriously and won't brush your input aside.Rest of Ironhack StaffSince the first day I applied and even now the staff at Ironhack hasn’t missed a beat. They have been helpful and there for me with any questions I had. They have an idea as to what they want to do with the course, and they definitely make sure that you receive the best experience possible. It doesn’t matter who you try to contact, the owner, down to the TA’s, they all respond happily and make you feel like one of them.Hiring Fair PrepFrom the first week at Ironhack, you become well acquainted with a man named Brito. Take his advice seriously if your goal is getting a job. He walks you through all the necessary steps to prepare you, such as building your resume, creating your LinkedIn, and lets you know about networking events to attend. He constantly brings in people to give speeches to you weekly. Brito is a great source for help and information so make sure you are constantly checking in with him. Along with all this prep work, you are also creating your portfolio during the course. You create 3 projects (on your own or in a small group) which showcase everything you've learned in the course from beginning to end and is the first step to the building of your portfolio.Hiring Fair EventAt the end of the course, Brito arranges companies to come to Ironhack and sit down with you for interviews. This is a valuable introduction for your first interviews. Eventually, you will be off doing interviews on your own and this hiring fair is a great way to evaluate what you did and didn't do so that ultimately you become more and more comfortable during them. Still, that doesn't mean you shouldn't take these interviews at the hiring fair seriously, definitely come prepared to nail them during the event - people DO get hired out of these. This is what you prepare for, and it helps to prepare for future interviews.Post Ironhack ExperienceAfter Ironhack, finding a job (if that is what you are there for) is the next battle. Brito is there with you every step of the way. He holds placements help meetings at Ironhack every other week and is always available for any questions you have. He guides you and reminds you that you must KEEP CODING and KEEP APPLYING. If you slack off on those two steps, the job hunt instantly becomes much harder. Take your LinkedIn, networking, and resume seriously. Do little projects on your own after the cohort, and make sure your JavaScript knowledge is fresh by doing coding challenges on HackerRank/Codewars because they will help with the technical interviews.I did not get hired immediately after Ironhack. I applied to around 300+ jobs and only got about two handfuls of phone interviews and in-person interviews. I got hired 3 and a half months after. I never stopped coding, I never stopped applying and I always kept in touch with Brito. This process in itself could feel more stressful than the boot camp, but do not quit.ConclusionYes - you learn a lot at Ironhack and are given great guidance, but no they will not hand you a job. You get everything you need from them and now it’s up to you to put in the work and land it. They are there with you every step of the way. I would 100% do it again, I put my life on hold, invested in myself, pushed through and changed my career into something I felt would be more fulfilling. So far it hasn’t disappointed one bit. Not only do you learn a lot at Ironhack, but you make tons of friends and become part of their great community.If you have any questions feel free to message me on LinkedIn and I will gladly answer them for youRead Less",ironhack

Read More going into it, because each class has multiple teaching assistants who will be there to help if you fall behind or are struggling to keep up. My class had 3 exceptional TA's, Manuel, Colby, and Adrian, who constantly were able to provide assistance when I ran into trouble, had bugs, or just got lost. They were always nice, patient, and willing to go the extra mile just to make sure I really understood deeply what we were learning, including coming in extra early on the weekends and spending one on one time with me in front of the whiteboard to go over each aspect of what we were learning in detail. I was really impressed with -and grateful for- each of them. I was also very impressed with the professor, Alan. He is an extremely knowledgeable person with a natural aptitude for teaching. Always patient, courteous, and welcoming of questions, feedback and taking time to ask us if we all understood or were running into any problems. What really impressed me most about Alan, is how he would take a little bit of time at the start of each class to go beyond the curriculum and to challenge us with computer science coding challenges, to prepare us to think like computer scientists, and get us ready for the types of questions we would likely see in a coding interview, and explain the different ways to approach the problems, and how to think about them in terms of time complexity or memory management. It was well beyond what I expected from a web development course, and I found these lessons particularly rewarding. Alan has a knack for breaking down complex and abstract concepts into digestible bits and getting the class comfortable enough to try and collectively attempt a solution. *Protip* Always volunteer to try and solve the problems he presents, I noticed the students brave enough to attempt these problems retained information better and walked away with a more solid understanding. If he gives you the marker, get up there and give it your best effort. Go home and research the concepts further. JUST DO IT! Get a whiteboard, for your house, and write important concepts, objectives, goals, and problem examples from class. This will force your brain to reconcile this new information on a daily basis. You will almost certainly see these types of coding challenges in job interviews, and they're abstract, and frustrating if you are not prepared.After graduation, you'll be counseled by Brito, your career counselor, who is also a very cool, down-to-earth and knowledgeable person. He has some real wisdom to share about the interviewing process, how to construct your resume, and specifically tells you to reach out to him before accepting any job offers. I am really impressed with his insight and willingness to be supportive, helpful, and make sure you land a good starting job, well after graduation. Looking back I am extremely thankful to Ironhack and humbled to have had the opportunity to study with such an awesome class. Everyone from my classmates to the teachers, to the teacher's assistants, to the career counselor have all been an absolute pleasure to deal with. Also, I was blown away by the Ux/UI students. We (the web dev class) got a chance to work with them in the hackathon (which was a totally awesome experience) and they were very impressive. I legitimately wish I could go take their class as well because they absolutely blew my mind with their systematic methodology, creativity, and organized thought processes. They were amazing. I loved working with them.  So to wrap it up, I wholeheartedly recommended Ironhacks web development course. 110%. Actively participate, ask questions, be engaged, help classmates, keep a positive attitude and this bootcamp will be a life-changing event for you as it has been for me.Read Less",ironhack

Read More pieces or enclaves in a society. In my particular case, immigrant and with more than 17 years previous working in the commercial area in Sales of Technology, having made the decision to invest in the training of Full Stack Web Development Boot Camp in Ironhack has meant a turning point in my career. And for me it has been precisely that: an investment in the future.When I decided that I wanted to return to the roots of my studies (I'm an Computer Engineer) after so many years without writing a line of code, concerned only about selling products that in some cases I did not understand what they do, I started a search for a study system that I could obtain the necessary knowledge to go in search of a job in what many years ago was my livelihood and why not, my satisfaction. For this I enrolled in some basic PHP / Javascript courses with MySQL Database and an additional Oracle Database 12c course. But they were just that: basic courses. They gave me an aerial view of what Web development is in these times but they did not go deep enough to feel safe to go after a job in the development area.And as in social networks there is nothing hidden (we know how the algorithms that make product suggestions work, learning our tastes and posting notices of topics that we have touched or visited previously) I saw in one of these networks, an advertising of a Full Stack Web training that caught my attention because of its content. It was not a simple computer course like other ones in the market. It was really a formal study where in two and a half months a good part of the tools, frameworks, methodologies, etc., would be covered for the development of Web applications. It described how we are going to go, from the basics to making applications that from a user's point of view were as complex as making calls to API's RestFUL of spatial geolocation to create technology trending Web applications. A walk through HTML, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript, JQuery, JSON, NodeJS, Express, Ajax, Axios, Angular all this with MongoDB Database, alternating with continuous development tools such as GIT and project planning as Trello. I found it a challenge and as I said initially, an investment for my return to the area that brought me so much satisfaction. Of course, I did an exhaustive search of trainings of this type in Madrid to make a comparative table and I finally decided on Ironhack because it seemed to me the most complete of all the training I saw, in addition to the fact that I am very learning in person, to be near the instructor and surrounded by people who could ask for help to clarify doubts if that were the case. For this reason, I proceeded to write via email to the contact person that appeared in the promotion. The answer was immediate and I started the procedures to be able to register for the FULL STACK WEB DEVELOPMENT BOOT CAMP - FULL TIME JUNE 2018 training. Here the journey began.Important to clarify that I did not have the money to do this training but here is another advantage that immediately allowed me to strengthen my decision. At Ironhack, they have two financial support institutions that could finance the training with the necessary flexibility to cover the costs. What more could I ask for!Now, I went through a series of questions and qualification interviews to validate if I had the capacity to do this training and that they did not represent a problem for me to enter since I had the advantage of having studied Computer Engineering 25 years ago and something was left of the programmatic thinking. I went immediately to the Pre-Work, a series of exercises and activities to soak students with certain basic knowledge and thus start from the first day to learn everything necessary to carry these two and a half months of intensive training. And that's what it is, that's why the denomination of "Boot Camp". Let's understand the concept. Here you come to work. And work hard. Every day, from Monday to Friday and including several weekends, is hard work. Beginning with the fact that two exercises (or projects) are done daily. One in the form of pair-programming, which gives us the notion of what it is to work with a team, and the other project you work individually. And some of these exercises tend to be extensive which makes it difficult to finish without staying up late (my personal recommendation for those who register: do not get up late, seek to do what possible but put a limit on working hours because fatigue accumulates day after day and every day you will see important matter that requires attention and all the senses in it). And every two weeks there will be a large project (three in total) where you can practice what you have learned in the previous weeks. For this reason, if you feel that some of the concepts were not well learned, calm that in each project will have the opportunity to resume and apply these concepts.It is true that many concepts are seen, but the learning methodology, being able to use continuous development tools such as GIT, working as a team in various exercises or projects, is basically what you face in real work environments. And for that they prepare you.Another important point to note is the support and ongoing advice on human resources issues, where you will have sessions to improve your Linkedin profile (or create it for those who have not registered) and your résumé. As an anecdote, just changing some things in my profile, I got the first day two contacts of people looking for Web developers from England. These consultancies are worth their weight in gold and should be used as much as they are part of the Ironhack program that seeks to position their students in the labour market. And believe me, its work.Finally, after two months and a week of continuous learning, Ironhack organizes a week called the "hiring week" where they invite a group of companies that will be validating your projects and interviewing students for possible work places to be filled with Boot Camp students. It is time to show your talents and you have a high chance of getting a job related to the topics seen. Particularly I had already gotten a job before this week so I did not attend and yet you have saved the opportunity to attend some future process if you wish.Finally, it must be understood that Ironhack, besides being a learning academy, is also a community. A community where events are constantly being published where you can review trends, new technologies or simply have an invitation to spend a Friday evening with friends with some beers. As a member of this community you can call to give a talk to new students about your experience, how to handle the stress of the activities, or simply accompany a new student under the figure of "buddy" in order to listen and advise how to carry The Boot Camp to these new members.Ironhack has been an experience, an investment that has paid off and allowed me to reinsert myself into the technical world, something that fills me with satisfaction. It was a total good experience in which a made a good friends and contacts in a web partners that for sure, is going to be maintained for years.Jesús Martínezwww.linkedin.com/in/jesus-martinez-alvarezRead Less",ironhack

244301,"Ryan Craig Martin",0,"Software Engineering",2018,1,"Associate Software Engineer","Full Stack Web Development - April - June 2018",9/13/2018,2018-09-13,"Full-time Web Development Bootcamp ",3.7,3.0,3.0,5.0,"In this review, I aim to provide an honest account of my experiences as a student in Ironhack’s April - June 2018 cohort in Miami, FL. I chose to wait until after I had been out of the course and in a job for a while before reflecting on my experience... Read More and evaluating how well Ironhack prepared me for what I am currently doing. My Ironhack Experience: Application: I did a great deal of research within a small period of time before applying, going through the interview process and leaving my previous employer to join Ironhack. Like many other students, I decided on Ironhack because of the curriculum, the reputation of Brito as an Outcomes Manager, and the reputation of their lead instructor Nizar, however, when the cohort started I learned that we would have a new instructor, Nick, an Ironhack graduate. When I registered for this course many of my classmates and I was under the impression that Nizar would be our teacher who I understood was someone with years of real world experience and was the primary reason for all the great reviews about Ironhack.I decided about three weeks before the cohort started to join in April which was just enough time before it was too late. The coding challenges and pre-work used the same online portal which contained their learning modules. Once I got the learning material I had to get them done within the one week I had before the cohort started so I worked that week on the online material full time to get ready for the first week. I cannot stress how important it is for you to really focus on the pre-work and understand the meaning behind what it is that you are going to be learning and do further research when necessary. If at any point you find yourself questioning whether or not this is for you, take time away from the problems you are having and come back to it with a fresh perspective. This is a habit you should try to incorporate in your learning as you are working with abstract concepts you haven’t been exposed to yet or are re-learning. It's really easy to get frustrated when you are first starting out which causes some students to drop out of the cohort before it really has time to start. Curriculum / Lectures / Projects: The first week is spent developing a browser game which when I initially signed up sounded like a lot of fun, and at times it was, however, I do not feel that it fits the curriculum when considering how much better the time could be spent. I would recommend spending more time to focus on the fundamentals, working collaboratively (git-flow), and more time on coding challenges/interview prep. Many of the examples within the modules when learning these new concepts were essentially the same which made it harder to grasp some of the concepts we were going over. A large portion of information, direction, and dependencies for the labs and lectures were out of date or not set up properly. Some learning modules were skipped altogether and a lot of time was wasted on bugs that can be avoided if the lecture notes and labs were updated or reviewed by the instructor before the lecture for the day began. I was also having a hard time grasping these concepts when I was encouraged to just copy paste what was in the modules to do my labs and my projects instead of thinking it though. There was a sudden change the day before the final project weeks started where our cohort was preparing to put together their individual projects for our personal portfolios and then it was announced that we would be working in groups for the last project. We were not told from the beginning that we were to take into consideration that we would be working on the final project in pairs or groups of three. We were never taught best practices dealing with version control and how to go about working with multiple people on a project at the same time. The brief overview that we had on collaborative git practices lasted less than 30 minutes and didn't even cover how to deal with merge conflicts or common errors that would come up in collaborative scenarios. Our instructor Nick was gone during the second to last week which was one of the most important weeks of our cohort. The majority of people in the course have been stuck on the same issue which dealt with having a login session persist across views in Angular. The only example we have to go off of was incomplete because of all of the bugs we ran into the week before Nick left and the TA’s were not able to figure out how to resolve the issue. If the Ironhack staff knew that he was going to be out during this important week that should have arranged for a substitute or have prepared the TAs to take over the curriculum for the week. The TAs would only be able to help to a certain extent until they are unsure of how to proceed due to their lack of experience and we're left to wait in line to be assisted by Nick, however that week we did not have the option so there was a great deal of lost time. My group members and I should not have been feeling the need to pay by the minute on tutoring websites like Hackhands and to make up for the lack of education we had received to get our project done in time. Learning Environment: I can’t speak for other cohorts, but the April 2018 cohort was fantastic. Everyone got along really well and we all still keep in touch with one another regularly post-graduation. Building.co is a fantastic workspace. Free beer, coffee, fruit, snacks, and there are plenty of good options for eating in the area. My only criticism is that Building.co can get a bit cramped at times as far as private areas for studying and meetings go, but that’s expected considering it’s a co-working space. The TAs were incredibly helpful throughout the cohort. Shoutout to Sandra for always staying far later than she needed to help us with our projects throughout the cohort. I’m sure I speak for all of my classmates when I say that we wouldn’t have been able to achieve what we did without the support of the TAs. Brito also brought in some great guest speakers and organized a panel of alumni to come to talk to us about their post-graduate experiences. Career Week: Career Week is the most important week you will at Ironhack. The content during this week is crucial to your job search and should be followed to the letter if you plan on getting hired and will be applicable beyond entry-level job searches. If you haven’t heard of or really considered Career Week as a selling point for your investment in an experience at Ironhack I would highly encourage you to reconsider and look at some of the companies that Ironhack is partnered with and the companies that graduates like myself are currently working at.Career week is a fantastic opportunity where companies come to Ironhack in order to interview graduates in a "speed dating” fashion. You get to meet with many companies, and if you are inexperienced with interviewing like I was at the time, it may help you to get over the nervousness of being in an interview. If you've read any of the other reviews on this site or other sites about Ironhack Miami I'm sure that you have read or heard the name Daniel Brito or Brito for short. Brito is the Outcomes Manager, and it is his responsibility to work towards partnerships with companies and bring them in to meet potential graduates as candidates for entry-level jobs. He’s one of the most connected people in the Miami tech scene and has your best interests in mind. Ironhack would not be the same without his efforts. He was one of the most supportive people throughout the entire cohort and has continued to help me after graduation and reach out to me to see how my new job is going.  Post-Graduation / Job Search: I received my job offer from CareCloud, one of the companies that came to our hiring fair, about a month and a half after the cohort ended. However, do not place all your bets on getting a job from one of the companies that come to career week, this would be a huge mistake. Brito will be there every step of your job search from interview to offer letter as long as you follow the guidelines and strategies that he goes into detail about throughout the week. Never stop coding during your search, it’s important to keep your committing to new projects and continuing your learning so that you have something to show employers what you’ve been doing with your time since graduation. If you lose your motivation to teach yourself after the cohort is over you’re going to have a very hard time finding a good job. Overall, I would recommend Ironhack to someone looking to make a career change, however, I would also like to see many things improved as it continues to grow. I felt that my cohort was disorganized and that there was a serious lack of curriculum preparation. I did not see efforts made to improve the quality of our experience throughout the cohort's duration although we were giving them feedback every few weeks. I was not satisfied with how my education at Ironhack turned out at the time of graduation. I went through career week and then graduated lacking the confidence in my skill set necessary to get through a real technical interview. The weeks following graduation I spent all my time working on projects and learning React which I knew would help me stand out more when looking for a job while reinforcing JavaScript fundamentals and applying to jobs using Brito's advice. I am currently writing up an accompanying article for this review that I hope will fill in any other gaps for those who are looking into or graduating from Ironhack and boot camps like it which will include helpful resources that I used before, during and after my boot camp experience that helped me get my new job at CareCloud.

My experience with Ironhack was absolutely fantastic and I would do it again, anytime. I will answer the questions I had when picking a bootcamp and hope this can help any future student. Why not do an online course ? What I found very special with Ironhack was how teachers and peers were an amazing motivation, something you don't get online. The teachers were available every day until 10 pm and even on weekends, which I found incredible, every time with a smile on their face. The teaching team also spend significant time on team building and allowing the students to get to know each other with after school events, cooking sessions, giving the whole experience a very personal touch. They were extremely helpful with every question I ever had, no matter how basic. Studying with a cohort of students and sharing a physical classroom made it much easier for me to keep it up even during hard days where the learning felt like a lot of work. Whats the niveau of the course and how much time do I need to spend during the course? I personally had some previous coding experience (Python and C++, but six years before the time of the course) and no idea about front end. There is elaborate pre-work distributed by Ironhack before the start of the physical course that allows you to prepare yourself if you feel insecure about being ready. I did not spend a lot of time on it and found that we were "caught up onto the same level" within the first days of the bootcamp. The course is intense and requires you to spend some long evenings in class, however, it is clear that everyone learns for themselves and teachers are supportive no matter what effort you make - if you keep it low for two days, you will not punished with a frown or less attention. Teachers continuously checked up on the students level of understanding and offered additional courses and catch-up sessions whenever needed. In general it does feel like the whole group goes from "0 to 100" in the two month, coding-wise. Does it make you job ready ?Totally. I personally was not looking for employment after the bootcamp as I was starting a Master's degree, but nevertheless talked to many CTOs, companies etc in the course of the bootcamp and realized how "good" you get at Ironhack. Talking to my peers and seeing where (and how quickly) they got hired gives me the confidence to say, it makes you absolutely job ready.Read Less",ironhack

If you can avoid working, please do, because this course WILL require time outside of the 400 hours you are put through, and then some.I was amazed by how knowledgeable our instructor (Nick) and TA's were (I'm talking about you Sandra and Marcos!) as well as the sense of community that is evident from the day you first walk in. Aside from the facts that my cohort missed out on Nizar and that we constantly had to skip over lessons just due to the pace at which we had to learn, I can honestly say that everything is set up for you to succeed. The curriculum is constantly changing with the latest and greatest so that's a huge plus too.This will be hard. It will challenge you, you'll learn something new every day, and you'll have to put in a lot of work and effort outside of the classroom. But it will be worth it.I'll end with a final note on my experience during the job hunt and the awesomeness of Daniel Brito (the Outcomes Manager). Don't you dare go ghost on Brito during your job hunt. He's your wing-man, your therapist, your cheerleader on the sidelines and more -as long as you Slack him first. It took me three months after graduating (and A LOT of rejection) to land the job I'll be starting in a few weeks. Don't be afraid to hear no. Keep trying, and, if you're trying to land a web dev role, KEEP CODING. And even if you're not, KEEP LEARNING. Don't be afraid to think outside the box when it comes to jobs - there are other roles willing to pay you for the skills you acquired - my current role doesn't require coding, but the skill helped me land it. Brito was there throughout the entire process, constantly keeping track of my progress, and rooting for me the entire time. I'm grateful to have gone through this experience because it really did change my life. I've made friendships that'll last me a lifetime and the return on my investment was better than I could've imagined.Read Less",ironhack

For your final project, you will work with a real company on an actual brief (in my case a start up specialised in car logistics), which is super interesting, and gives you a sneak peek of your future professional life as a UX/UI designer.It is definitely an intense program, where you have to assimilate lots of knowledge in a limited amount of time.

If you’re not very social, this can be tiring.Scheduling/organization seems to be a bit of an issue. Some examples: having (somewhat required) career prep sessions or activities during our lunch breaks, never receiving reinforcement lessons, catching up on courses during our project weeks, etc. This probably depends a lot of the cohort and the other factors, but some things just seemed last second and/or badly timed.+ the positives +The materials are good, and the staff is nice, but the stand out was our instructor, Nizar. He is truly an excellent teacher; enthusiastic and very clear in his manner of explaining (simple and complex) concepts. I could not have asked for a better instructor for the course.The career services were also super helpful. The Outcomes Manager, Dina, helped us with our resumes, rebranding, and explaining our background to recruiters. We got to meet with many companies, as well as recruitment sites.

I can honestly say that none of that would have been possible without Ironhack.*For future students, a knowledge of French will be helpful.

Needless to say, the bootcamp experience is really not for the weak hearted. It pushes you beyond your limits and tests you on every level to really pull out the best within each student.The most important skill I’ve learned during my time at Ironhack was to get comfortable with being uncomfortable. That’s essentially the nature of the course; it forces each student to enhance their strengths, but most importantly, work on their weaknesses. There is limited time to get assignments done, so exercising better time management is essential. There are presentations and public speaking almost every week, there is the constant exercise of accepting failure and making mistakes, and the idea that perfection is your enemy (so if there are any perfectionists out there, get ready to let go of this habit guys, because everything is actually supposed to be “Agile”). I also learned that throughout any UX/UI design process, the user should always be the guide, and you really have to follow and respect the process, never jump to solutions. The staff at Ironhack was very helpful and most importantly, were always positive. It really helps to be surrounded by instructors and TA’s who believe in each student’s potential, who are ready to listen when you need to vent, who provide constructive feedback, any help needed or just be uplifting with optimistic comments. I am very grateful to everyone at Ironhack who guided me throughout the cohort: my teacher, David, my TA’s Hugo and Hector, my Web Dev week instructors Sandra and Colby, as well as Brito, our super dedicated Career Resources professional! They just made my time in the cohort extremely enjoyable and meaningful.Also, being in such an amazing co-working environment such as Building, helped make the experience memorable. I really love it there, I always feel welcome and comfortable, like it is my home away from home. I have spent A LOT of time there, and I love the fact that students have access to the space 24/7 with the use of the fob (I didn’t want to return mine at the end of the cohort!). It is no wonder I would always tell people who asked me about the course that I would live at Building and sleep in Aventura. I cannot express enough how much I loooooved being in that space and am happy to return each time I visit. Everything about it was awesome: the classroom environment with the ability to write and ideate on the white walls, cover the glass walls with our sticky notes, the nook with the comfy couch on the 2nd floor, cafecito at 3:05 brought to us everyday by the very sweet ladies: Mercedes and Maria, and especially the rooftop with the beer on tap. It is just a great space to get inspired, work, and also to network.The only cons I have for the cohort, is that I wish the course were longer. I personally think 3 months would be ideal, but if not, then at least 2 weeks extra so that the students can have more time to work with the web devs and also to better prepare for the hiring week. I felt an enormous amount of pressure to get my portfolio ready and honestly didn’t feel comfortable with what I presented to perspective employers. So it is important to have either an extra week to solely focus on that or to incorporate it more throughout the cohort (weekly check-ins on the progress, time for business cards to be made). It was constantly drilled into us that “the portfolio is what will get you hired”, so quality time to work on it is essential. Students will be better prepared and most likely result in more hires right out of the hiring fair. So, win win on both ends: great for the students as well as the school. Being able to work more closely with the web dev cohort is also essential in order to better prepare for the field. It would be great to work with them in fully developing one of our projects into a functional app, for example.Overall, my experience at Ironhack was very positive and this was the best investment I have done for my career. I had to overcome a lot of personal difficulties and blockers along the road, but truthfully, there is nothing more fulfilling than when you overcome something that initially might seem impossible, whether that is fear of public speaking or just delivering assignments on time. I loved every minute of the cohort and will forever be a proud Ironhacker. I have made incredible friends, developed a great support system with the school, and am excited as well as ready for what is yet to come!!! Cheers!!!Read Less",ironhack

Ironhack has a great network here in South Florida and companies absolutely notice their name on a resume or LinkedIn profile.Continue reading for a more detailed look at my journey at Ironhack.Background: I never worked in anything tech or programming related. I had some programming experience from undergrad and from there on out, I have been taking steps to improve my development skills but felt like I hit a wall.Why I joined: I wanted to build a portfolio and break down that wall. I wanted to switch careers and become a developer/engineer. I chose Ironhack over their competition because of the MEAN Stack, these reviews, and the passion and family-like culture I received upon initial contact with the staff.Staff: Ironhack keeps expanding and stays progressive with their vision and every employee really cares and believes in that vision. From the top down, everyone is approachable and makes you feel at home. Your instructor? IronhackerTA's? IronhackersThey have been in our shoes. They know what it takes to push you and make sure they set you up for success. They are happy to do it. It is not a "job" for them, it's a passion. My cohort had a new instructor, Nick. Everything I had read about Ironhack before joining was about Nizar and I had high expectations. Nick did a great job, and he had a great team of TA's too. Lead TA - Sandra is a machine. You will not fall behind even with the fast pace because of this.Experience: HIRED 6 weeks after hiring fairTo get the most out of this course, you will live, eat, breathe, and dream code. This is 9 weeks full time, and 1 more for hiring week. In these 10 weeks, do not expect to have a life outside of Ironhack. Make sure you have the full support of a significant other because it is not an easy balance. Your friends will be non-existent. It's a boot camp for a reason. Even with some coding experience, I would find myself still at Ironhack until 10-11pm most days. Project week will hit you like a ton of bricks. Beer on tap will keep you sane.On the bright side, you are going to be in a setting with dozens of people who have the same mindset and goals as you. This makes it a lot easier.What isn't obvious is that it does not stop after these 10 weeks. When you are looking for work afterward, it is also a full-time job. Expect to be looking for work for 4-8 weeks minimum.And it doesn't stop there. If you get hired, it's going to feel like another boot camp. So make sure you take that all into account before jumping in and make sure you can be fully committed. Job assistance: There is a hiring fair set up by Brito that at the very least will give you some practice on interviewing. I interviewed with 6 companies and with two of those, I went through their whole interview process afterward. I did not get hired by a company from the hiring fair (but others did).Brito makes sure you are taking necessary action in your job hunt and guides you. I applied aggressively and was able to land multiple phone interviews and several in-person interviews. Rejected by plenty, but in the end, I was able to get multiple offers.Conclusion: I would do it all over again if I could. I knocked down that wall and changed careers, and made great friends at the same time. Tips: Take your LinkedIn and resume seriously. Attend tech events and meetups. Try to do coding challenges on HackerRank and/or CodeWars.Feel free to message me on LinkedIn if there is anything else you'd like to know.Read Less",ironhack

Brito goes above and beyond in helping students learn best practices for job interviews, job tracking, soft skills interviews and generally how to get out there into the real world after the bootcamp is over. The mock interviews and actual interviews are great practice, if nothing more. The guest speakers Brito gets to come in are also a real treat and a part I looked forward to every week of the course. There really is no better way to learn than to hear from actual people who are in the field and have tons of experience already.All in all, I went into the course expecting to leave with a lot more UX/UI knowledge, but I left with so much more.

I’ve tried to learn by myself, with free online courses, with paid online courses (actually one from Codecademy), but nothing compares to being more than 12 hours a day coding non-stop, doing pair programming, being in a class with other 20 people with the most different backgrounds and experience levels.At the end of the course we go through a Hiring Week, where we had like 40 interviews with companies wanting to hire people for IT jobs.

Read More development, but I wasn't sure yet. Everything I knew at that point was self taught, so I figured I needed some serious study in order to feel more confident. After three months of intense studying during the bootcamp, I must say that I managed to build a web app and I had the guts to apply for a front end position. After some trial and error, I finally got the job I wanted :)The pros of the bootcamp are that it's really accessible, that there were people there to support us even at 9 - 10pm, that the final project we worked for was really practical and mentored by people working in the field and that at the end we had great opportunities for interviews.I really liked that the levels of people in the cohort really varied so while some fellow students could help me with certain issues, I could, in my own turn, help other with different issues. This way, you never feel too bad about yourself. We also worked really hard, till late in the night sometimes, and the tutors were there to help. They were really nice, supportive and dedicated. For the final project, based the profile of the project, we got matched with someone working in the field. At the end, looking at what I had built, I felt proud and confident that I could take that app further. The tutors also helped us optimise our linked in profiles, we had professional photos taken and really felt that they did everything to help us find a job that we like.For me, the biggest benefit was that I figured out what I liked from web development (specifically Front End development) and that I gained confidence to apply for the job I wanted.The cons are that, indeed, being very accessible, you get people with very different backgrounds and for some it can be very difficult. I had some knowledge of how the web works, of HTML and CSS, but for who doesn't have any knowledge, I think it can be pretty frustrating to dive straight into web development with all its aspects. Also, Back End and Front End are a lot to cover in 3 months, so I would actually prefer it if they were separate. Then you'd have more time to practice everything properly. Sometimes it felt rushed, because we had a curriculum to go through. That's about it. All in all, it's really helpful if you wanna taste the web development world and you're not sure which way to go. It also helps to fill in the gaps, if you have some knowledge already, but in bits and pieces, like I did. Good luck!Read Less",ironhack

A week after finishing the course, after metting almost 40 IT companies, all of them convened by Ironhack and most of them of hight standing, with numerous and attractive professional offers, I was signing with one of those companies that I was attracted the most, furthermore, it exceeded my expectations of learning, self development and gave me the possibility of working with cutting-edge technologies. In the end the extended knowledge I got during the Bootcamp allowed me to create three large projects to present to these companies that led them to get a better idea of ​​my new abilities and recently acquired capacities.What would you highlight?1.- The training, magnificent, very tuned to what companies require and very refined after the experience of many previous bootcamps' feedbacks.2.- The teachers, full of knowledge and close to us, they would always be available, either in person or through the chat that we used.3.- The facilities, forefront and opened 7 days a week in which we passed around 12-14 hours at least 6 of them (7/7 the week of the final project). Comfy, well provided kitchen, WiFi and resting areas.4.- The great level of camaraderie and union shared among the students. As we spend those many hours together in my Bootcamp the atmosphere was always priceless, I had the opportunity to meet some very interesting people with whom nowadays I continue to maintain contact beyond the mere professional level.5.- The large number of Meetups and meetings that are offered to help to expand knowledge and to facilitate net-working.6.- The great work of follow-up and labor orientation that is done during and after the Bootcamp.7.- The enormous effort that is made to generate community among all the Alumni, encouraging them to maintain contact, arranging open Meetups on the Ironhack campus or simply to share a beer on Fridays.IMPORTANT: In case it is not clear, the 9 weeks full-time Bootcamp that I did, requires you to be very very focused on your work (as I said, I only rested one day a week and in the week of the final project not even one). There will be many frustrating moments when you face difficulties and hight demanding code problems. Many of the daily exercises you can not do whole. The teachers are there to help but they will not take you by the hand. Actually all that is in fact designed to be that way, it is precisely this challenge that leads you to quickly acquire the knowledge, resources and ease necessary in the 9 weeks of the course.SUMMARY: Without a doubt, the best decision I ever took. It has allowed me to redirect my career with satisfaction. It has allowed me to acquire great knowledge in a field that I am passionate about. It has helped me to meet great people and to feel part of a community that is always there when you need it. In the end, the reward has been much much greater than the effort invested (also economically speaking). Once an Ironhacker, always an Ironhacker.Read Less",ironhack

Right away I maid the desition of joining the Bootcamp, a shortcut to get a well-paid job that I really liked. One week after starting the UX Bootcamp I thought to myself: "Now, I'd definitely get the job!". I learned everything about design thinking, lean &amp; agile methodologies, how to craft a UX Strategy and deliver a meaningful UI, always taking a user-centered approach to problem-solving and product design. Ironhack's staff and the teachers' board were beyond generous to help me achieve my goal, getting my first job in IT and becoming a Digital product creator. I even moved from Madrid to Barcelona and could enjoy career service in either Campus. I got a job during week 6 due to my modest front-end abilities and eagerness to learn more. My classmates are still friends, we try to stay in touch and inspire one another, share job opportunities and help us continue learning. Now I can say I'm fully immersed in IT, have a better-paid job and can see my career evolution in this field.

In the morning you would study and follow along with a lesson for about three hours. Then you would make an excercise applying these lessons with a partner.

The help that we get in getting jobs is great, present from the very beggining and gradualy increasing until it becomes the main focus for the week after graduation. In general I feel like I got my money's worthI did have 5 years learning how to code before-hand though, and I feel like that helped me a great deal. So what does this mean for people who have no experience with coding at all? Actually not much. Ironhack provides a pre-work material that I was very impressed by. It has everything that I think someone should know before starting the course. They say it should take about 60 hours of work and they are not kidding. But it has everything you should need to succeed in the class. Again, the material is really good, but you have to go over it. They can only cover so much in class (and it will be a lot) but the course is structured in such a way that, to really get the most out of the course, you should be going over most if not all of the lessons. Then there are the labs. For most days there will be two hands-on labs. Which I thought was great. They are all really great little tests of the topics that have just been covered. Sadly quite a few of them had typos that made the instructions confusing. We did meet the person who is working on fixing them though. A previous Ironhack graduate who is passionate about getting those issues hashed out. So one of the few dings that I would give the class will probably not be relevant to whomever reads this. And for us it was not all that bad, since the instrutor and TAs were aware of the issues and were able to direct us in the right direction.Other than the labs, there are 3 big projects, one at the end of every module. Which is one of the best parts of the course in my opinion. It forces students to create things that they can show as experience and were where I learned the most in the course. Simple examples are great, but putting a complete project together really helps everything sink in. Overall, I would recommend the course to anyone willing and capable to fully commit to put in the time and effort both in and out of class. There is a lot to get out of the course, but you will only get proportionally to what you put in.Read Less",ironhack

My name is Beltran, I’m 27 years old and I have no programing experience before IronHack.Now, why did I decided to leave everything and start the Web Development bootcamp here in Ironhack? There’s no easy answer to that question so let me put a little... Read More bit of background before trying to explain myself.I started working in Hospitality at the same time I was studying my psychology grade in the university. I always though that this little jobs I was doing were just temporal jobs until I became a Staff member in one restaurant. That was the moment I realized that I didn’t wanted this as my professional career, so I started looking something more related to what I really like, and there is when I found Iron Hack.So i decided to leave everything and start a new adventure in IronHack. And I have to say that I don’t regret at all my decision. My experience in IronHack can be summarized in just a few words: “Fear, surprise, work and ‘Sadpiness’”.Fear? Why Fear?When you decide to make such a change, to get out of your confort zone, to try something new its absolutely normal to feel fear. Fear of change, fear of the future, etc. This fear disappears in the first days of class because you meet a lot of people that have made that change too.Don’t let the fear make your choices.Surprise.That’s what I felt when I started learning “difficult” things that I never heard of before, and I liked them. And talking about them, using them, and even helping others with problems you already faced makes you think “I never though I could learn those things”.Work.I’m not going to lie to you, I spent more or less 12-14 hours a day working there. I entered at 9:00 in the morning at I left between 21:00 and 23:00. Its hard? Yes it is, but its worth the effort. And when you really realized how much time has passed your are finishing your last project on your own, thinking about how fast the bootcamp has passed.Sadpiness.Sadpi… what?Its a new word I have invented because I don’t know how to express the feeling you have when you finish the bootcamp. Its Sad because all the people you met, you suffer with, you laugh and sometimes cried. All that people that helped you and you helped during this fantastic journey, are going to take their paths. The bond you make with them is strong enough to keep the contact and take a beer once a week (or twice). But not only with your companions, all the IronHack Staff is always willing to help you, teachers, TA’s, etc. Thats when you realized you have entered this little big family called IronHack.And of course is Happiness too because when you finish, you look back and see how much you have changed, without knowing it in most of the cases, in just 9 weeks.To finish, people ask me hot to define IronHack, and after thinking about it I just can say one thing: Ironhack is a life changing experience.Read Less",ironhack

Every week, you also practice A LOT by doing the exercises, which are really helpful to understand the common mistakes.The first part is for HTML, CSS, and Javascript, which are the basics for front-end development. For me, this was the hardest part, because raw Javascript may have a logic that could be hard to understand at the beginning. But as you go forward you learn a lot, and the teachers are very dedicated to help you. At the end of this part 1, you have to develop a game; which is a very cool way to practice and learn as you code.The second part is the back-end part, learning NodeJs and Express. You just have to learn the logic and copy/paste what is in the Ironhack course and in the documentation to make everything work. You will learn how to manage a database and use APis (Google Maps' API, Spotifiy' API, etc).The last part, my favorite one, is to merge front-end and back-end, using NodeJs and REACT, which is a very cool language. Inititally the plan was to learn AngularJs, but the teacher decided to make us learn React, which is most demanded and very useful for what we will have to do.

Having learned Vue during the boot camp, it has not been difficult to learn React as an example. Additionally, and this is something that sets Ironhack apart from the competition, we had the opportunity to interact directly with UX/UI designers/students. It sensitized me to the importance of UX/UI and my projects benefited greatly from the feedback I received.What I would recommend prospective students is to talk with the teachers. Ask them a couple of questions and see if the way they explain the concepts fits your needs. You will spend a lot of time asking questions and the teacher answering them, so the interaction must work for you. You can also talk to the students (and enjoy a couple of beers while at it) or attend the hack shows to take a look at the products the students built. The aspect I enjoyed the most about the boot camp was the people involved. The staff was very supportive and all students were just great.

Read More not so great. Typos, outdated instructions, some lessons were skipped, and you had to wait for the class teacher to troubleshoot the LESSONS GIVEN TO YOU BY IRONHACK because they were incorrect. But my biggest gripe was that the lesson instructions were outdated. If you followed some of the instructions step-by-step, your app would fail. This was incredibly frustrating. You couldn't really study at home because you couldn't trust the instructions. You'd had to wait for class to find out if the material GIVEN to you was either correct or incorrect. I hated that because I paid a ton of money and I received sub-par class materials.If it wasn't for Alan's fast troubleshooting and helpful guidance to overcome the incorrect provided instructions, by whoever wrote the curriculum directions, as well as Brito's amazing help to find me a job fast AND my very own will to invest extra money in outside sources like Pluralsight, Codeacadamy, and books, I would have given IRONHACK a piece of my mind and legally disputed the payment sent to them. My recommendation to IRONHACK is to replace whoever wrote the instructions that we followed daily in class with someone who is more dedicated to double-checking their work. Class instructions need to be accurate and easily readable. Memes and incorrect instructions don't teach us anything.I also hope the class materials, that I PAID for, are updated continuously as time goes by. The instructions are ONLINE for god's sakes. I'm an alumnus of this school and as a customer who paid money, I should be able to go back to the material to study without worrying that my course materials are outdated or forgotten, even 5 years later. Everyone should have access to the same material whether you're from the first class ever in Ironhack to the 50th. If you update the instructions, it should update for ALL who have access to the student portal.In conclusion: The school is overall great. Alan and Brito were amazing and have earned my respect and it's because of their great work ethic that I did not raise hell. I couldn't say the same for the person who wrote the instructions found in http://learn.ironhack.com/If you're a student, I recommend you review the course material within the first week with someone else to make sure your material is correct.

I can say this: I came into Ironhack with an incomplete computer science degree... Read More and no meaningful work experience, and left with three scheduled job interviews, and I had a competitive entry-level developer job offer within two weeks of graduating. I don't think my experience is typical, but I do feel safe in assuming that if you come here prepared and work hard while you're here, you can leverage the experience into a new career.Before signing up, though, it's worth mentioning that the curriculum and instruction is in a period of transition. The previous instructor, Nizar, moved from Miami to Paris, and was replaced with Louis. Louis lacked Nizar's experience, and became less professional as the cohort went on, being less prepared for more advanced material and often leaving mid-day, letting the TAs (Jess and Sandra, who were both fantastic) manage the class. Louis isn't coming back - he decided to go to Japan after finishing the cohort - and I'm not sure who his replacement is. If you're interested in the camp, that's the first thing I'd ask about.The curriculum is largely solid, but has a few intermittent bugs and grammar issues. Honestly, though, I'd rank it above my college experience in terms of usefulness and structure, as well as any class I've seen on places like Udemy. It's intelligently structured, and gives you the information required to learn the skills necessary to complete exercises and build projects. They're also actively working on fixing issues in the curriculum right now, and it's a safe assumption that you will have a cleaner experience with the material than I did.I think the quality of the job assistance matters more than the quality of instruction in a bootcamp - realistically you could teach yourself everything here with a few Udemy courses, a solid work ethic, and maybe some contacts in the coding community or online - but it's hard to leverage that into a job. Job assistance is where Ironhack shines. Their job placements manager, Daniel Brito, is constantly working phones and email to get respected developers in the community to give presentations and companies looking for talent to come to hiring fairs. He has tons of resources to teach you how to manage your job hunt, and is pretty much constantly available for questions on Slack (or in emergencies, his phone). This effort is reflected in the experience - if you do as he says, you'll develop contacts in the Miami tech community, which will lead to job offers. It's also worth noting the location is incredible. The building is right next to a train stop in downtown Miami as well as a decent parking garage, and is blocks away from dozens of fantastic restaurants. The building itself is also amazing - it's a well-appointed coworking place with free snacks, coffee, and beer on tap. It was scary signing up for Ironhack, but I honestly think it was the smartest decisions I've ever made in my entire life. I learned an employable skill in less than three months, got to make dozens of friends with other like-minded and driven people, and leveraged the experience into a new job. Expect to work hard - the 400 hour estimate they give you is low, and the most successful students were those that showed up a few hours early and left a few hours later - but if you do, it'll change your life.One more thing - if you decide to sign up for Ironhack, take a cohort date a few months from now, and spend some time learning the material. Colt Steele's Web Development bootcamp and Advanced Web Development bootcamps on Udemy are a fantastic primer for the large majority of the class, and completing at least the first course beforehand will give you a huge leg-up on learning skills well and making solid, presentable projects, which will help you significantly when job hunting.Read Less",ironhack

The staff was very friendly, but seemed to be a bit desorginzed. I say this because there where several trips and exchanges of personal, which didn't leave much time for us to get to know them and learn from them.One thing I would advise strongly, which I think was a big error in my experience, is to never leave the cohort with less than 1 instructor and 2 TA's. Unfortunatley in our last two weeks, which coincided with the two weeks we had to prepare our final projects, our teacher left every day at 1pm, and didn't help much during the morning he was there, and one of our TA's took another position within Ironhack, which left just one person helping a class of 20. This was extremly unfair, for everybody had doubts and needed help, but there was only one person to clear them. Thankfully in the second week a new TA joined the class, but even though he had good predisposition, he had not been with the cohort during the whole course, so the amount of help he could provide was different.Still, taking the good and the bad, I think I learnd a lot, and I'm happy with the experience.Read Less",ironhack

Learn latest technologies The school is... Read More aware of how the market evolves. That’s why in previous editions they’ve teach Ruby on Rails or React. Don’t worry on the technology, just trust them, companies are always interested for the latest techs as they are trying to get updated.  I was surprised to see that even programmers with 10 years experience were joining the bootcamp to get updated on technologies. Companies will value those learning’s, don’t worry. 2.	A dedicated team that encourages learning At Ironhack I’ve coded next to smart and passionate teachers. I was surprised by 6:30pm after 9 hours coding they were there teaching me last details of the lesson I hadn’t understood or even helping me improve my projects. One teacher and three assistants on the full-time bootcamp, where else are you gonna find that much support?! Moreover, the rest of the staff is unbelievably friendly and supportive. They will weekly ask you for feedback and make that you feel like at home (that’s for example how we got our BBQ at the rooftop and a Ping-Pong table) :D. Believe me you’re gonna get surrounded by an awesome atmosphere. Staff takes very seriously on QUALITY, proved through the learning units, IT events, job placement, fully equipped kitchen and much more. 3.	Hiring week Compared to other bootcamps or online courses, Ironhack were the only ones offering some kind of direct shortcut for placement. Last week you have the opportunity to get interviewed by 20-30 companies. They do not assure you to get a job, but definitely you’ll have an experience on how to deal and prepare for technical interview. You won’t lack of a job on IT field if you work on your skills.4.	Awesome classmates This will depend on every cohort. Usually Barcelona attracts people from all around the world (in my cohort: Canadians, Italians, Germans, Austrians, Caribbean, Portuguese and of course Spaniards). Sincerely, I am gonna miss my mates a lot. They were the reason and the necessary support to keep coding by 8:00pm, when all what your head whisper to you is: “Go home!” We’ve spend great time together having Ironbeers, roomscape, music festivals, lunch at the restaurant (of course, most of it on weekends, week if for coding haha). I also want to thank the UI/UX students. We’ve had the opportunity to collaborate at some point and also see their projects as they have seen and advice on ours. We’ve also had true programmers coming from different industries to evaluate our projects in order to decide for the three contestants that deserve to present in the Hackshow. All this makes the experience much more complete and close to the real working world.5.	Coding bootcamp, online courses or autonomous learning at home? I speak from personal experience: I’ve tried learning from home, but then if you get blocked maybe you can spend 4 hours with no clues. That gets soon very frustrating and increases the chance you give up with code. That’s not how it is supposed to be in the working environment. You’ll probably get great contents with other online courses, but as soon as you want to go further you may face technical problems. At Ironhack, teachers give you the right support to be little bit creative at the same time they train you with all the basics to be able to continue your own-training after the bootcamp. 6.	Full-time or Part-time Both are great! Part-time will require you the endurance to go coding after your other regular timetable that you follow, but also full time will challenge you 9:00 to 21:00 for 9 intensive weeks… be ready to abandon all other social compromises that are not having beers with your Ironmates!  Part-time also allows you to develop your projects more calmly (as you have almost one month to deliver each one of the final projects), but then it will depend on your discipline to commit to work even at home.

If you are a person that feels uncomfortable with the comfortable and aspire a career where you feel that your effort work is really meaningful than just go for it. In the review I try to stress out why Ironhack is the right choice for you. Enjoy the read : )TEACHERS &amp; CURRICULUMI couldn’t think of better teachers than the ones from Ironhack. Learning from Andre, our main teacher, was an incredibly valuable experience. He is not at all comparable to any other teacher I met in the course of my academic journey. He is inspiring, incredibly skilled and knowledgeable in all realms of the industry. The same applies to the great technical assistants. Everyone is really eager to help you and motivate you throughout the course. I don’t want to sugarcoat anything, the curriculum is intense and your personal outcome also depends a lot on yourself and how much effort you put in. Be consistent and don’t stress out when you don’t get a concept right a way. You will get there with sufficient practice. As Andre taught us, they give us the shoes; we are the ones to put them on. Apart from the curriculum, you will have the chance to educate yourself in related fields. Almost everyday there are events, lectures and workshops that you can attend. BARCELONA OPEN SPACEWhen it comes to the right location for you to attend a bootcamp, Barcelona is definitely the place to be; the city is vibrant, young and is known for its growing tech scene. I recommend you to make use of all the great facilities that the Ironhack office provides. You’ll have the possibility to be at Ironhack 24/7. The open space with all its facilities offers you the perfect place to unfold your potential and really immerse into the world of programming. There is also a flat upstairs with a nice rooftop to study and have a barbecue with your IH friends to unwind after hours of learning and coding. The staff really trusts you guys and gives you all the freedom you need to feel as comfortable as possible. They are all really attentive to your needs and are very perceptive to any feedback. In general, the staff is always friendly and always approachable with whatever question you have.JOB PERSPECTIVESRegarding job perspectives, it is a bit too soon to be opinionated since it’s two days since the bootcamp is over. However, if it helps you to get an idea, everyone from the previous cohort landed a developer job before our cohort ended. The placement manager as well as the rest of the team are really supportive and provide help with your portfolio. Also, the hiring week at the end of the bootcamp will help you to get in touch with different tech companies in Barcelona. PREPARATIONI’d like to make a short remark for those of you who have no prior knowledge. Although the program does not require any prior preparation besides the pre-work, I strongly recommend you to prepare yourself upfront using free online resources with main focus on JavaScript. It will keep your frustration level lower in case you are starting from scratch. However, don’t feel intimidated by this, it is not required and you can go along without any pre-knowledge.IRONHACK FAMLast but not least, I would like to address a very special thing about the program. When applying for Ironhack, I mainly focused on the learning experience itself and haven’t thought so much about the positive factors that this course brings along. But believe me, it’s the piiiiipool that make this experience so unforgettable! Although you might think that 2 1/2 months are a pretty short time to build close relationships, the bootcamp will prove you wrong!! You will have an amazing time with amazing likeminded people and will grow close together as a group. The group dynamics were unbelievable. We did a lot of different activities where everybody was included from day 1. We had legendary Friday nights, did rooftop BBQs, ping pong tournaments, samba nights, skiing trips and so much more). The Ironhack quarter really becomes your first home, the people your family and coding the nexus between both!

If you time it just right, your weekday classes will cost $6 to park there and the Saturday class will be $10. You can also find street parking around the area but pay attention to the signs!3. You will have homework during the class - expect to spend 10 hours a week on this, excluding your class project and your capstone - you will spend more time on those and you might have a couple late nights building presentations. If you don't do your homework, I will find you and I will haunt you personally.4.

You'll find that this community is full of dedicated, hard working and caring individuals - we all want each other to be successful. ---The instructors:We had Joel, Marcelo, Alex and Fernando teaching us. I hope that every cohort has these teachers or at least similar people - I cannot express how awesome they were. All of our teachers were excellent life/career coaches to us and all of them have been continuously supportive and available to us no matter what day/time it is. Joel taught us mostly about the overall process, Alex taught us about research, Marcelo taught us about visual design and sketch/flinto, and Fernando taught us HTML/CSS/Bootstrap. All of the instructors are local heroes in the industry and all will be able to teach you every tool you need to become a successful UX designer.---The staff:The staff at Ironhack is amazing. You'll have a TA helping you through your exercise; lean on them for support! You'll also interact with the Ironhack staff at various events and they will come cheer you on in your presentations. I really love the staff at Ironhack because they are warm, caring, inviting and always available. Alia was my first introduction to Ironhack and she has been absolutely amazing. She helped me figure out that I would be a great fit for the UX program, and I am SO glad that she did. The staff really went out of their way to come after hours to support us, even though they'd already worked a full day. They also came on weekends occasionally and I always felt like they cared about our success. Brito will be available to you for career help and to walk you through how to find a job, how to interview, how to create a resume, etc. He is invaluable and extremely well connected. You have no idea how lucky you are :-)---Overall:I had the most amazing experience and I know that I can walk into any interview with confidence and the tools I need to succeed. Everyone in my cohort really bonded; we are all group texting now and I know that each of us are rooting for each other's success. I will always be there to help my classmates and I know they'll be there for me, too!Honestly, a true testament to the fact that I like Ironhack and the teaching method so much: I decided to take the full-time front-end web development class, which graduates in June. This means I won't be joining my cohort's career fair, but I have no doubt my classmates will be successful and land their dream jobs :-)Given the feedback that I've received throughout this course, I have no doubts I'll be able to land the perfect job when I'm ready to start looking.Read Less",ironhack

Personalmente, es la mejor decisión...

Me explico: En Ironhack aprendes MEAN Stack (Mongo, Express,Stack Angular, Node) + HTML5 &amp; CSS. Y esos conceptos aún con el poco tiempo con el que disponemos, arraigan en tu cerebro como si llevaras meses estudiándolos. Yo tenía un poco de Background en temas de CSS y HTML y en la primera semana ya estaba aprendiendo cosas nuevas que no sabía.Una vez acabado el Bootcamp puede estudiar cualquier tecnología de manera autosuficiente. Esa seguridad que te da el aprender cosas nuevas y saber que puedes hacerlo, no tiene precio.2- El equipo: Teacher &amp; Ta's.- Decir impresionante, me quedaría corto, por lo que voy a decir únicamente que somos unos afortunados por tener a estos profesionales enseñándonos todos los días. André es una bestia en lo que a conceptos y manera de enseñar se refiere, personalmente es una persona muy cercana y se puede hablar con él de cualquier cosa. Sabe transmitir los conceptos de una manera sencilla y fácil de entender, y creedme, en este mundo no es nada fácil. Los TA's (teacher assistant) están ahí en cada momento en el que necesitamos ayuda y nos quedamos atascados en algún ejercicio y/o proyecto. 3. La familia Ironhack.- Desde el primer momento nos sentimos cómo en casa, nos dijeron que pasaríamos más horas ahí que en nuestra propia casa (no me lo creí al principio, pero... si, es cierto). Y es que al final, preferías quedarte aquí con tus amigos trabajando que irte a casa a hacerlo solo.El staff que está con nosotros es impresionante, desde el primer día te cuidan para que estés a gusto. Nunca han tenido una mala palabra, ni un gesto raro, ni una mirada especial. Estoy encantado de haberl@s conocido a tod@s, no sería lo mismo si no estuvieran aquí.Las instalaciones son perfectas para el tipo de "trabajo" que estamos desarrollando aquí. Si tuviera que hacer mi propio Ironhack lo haría de la misma forma que lo hacen ellos, cada centímetro está pensado a la perfección para que los que estamos estudiando aquí como los que trabajan estén a gusto.Finalmente y una de las cosas que me llevo y recordaré toda mi vida; los compañeros. Desde el principio congeniamos muy bien, la mayoría de nosotros estamos aquí para dar un cambio a nuestra vida laboral y en su efecto a nuestra vida en general. Tenemos muchas cosas en común y somos muy parecidos en la manera de ser (algunos más y otros menos) pero con el equilibrio que en todo sitio se necesita. Hacemos actividades conjuntas casi cada día (no es obligatorio!), desde Cervezas cada Viernes(y su fiesta posterior) hasta BBQ los fines de semana, Scape Rooms y visitas por la ciudad.Finalmente, si has llegado hasta aquí es porque lo estás pensando muy seriamente, no lo dudes.

He is able to meet you where you are and is accommodating to your needs in the classroom. It’s easy to feel incompetent in such a large subject that is completely new, but Nizar and his team do a great job of making you feel comfortable in a challenging space.

The bootcamp provides you a great foundation along with a large network of talented individuals who are more than willing to help you navigate through the tech realm as many are completely new to this space.

They keep you well informed on all things tech happening in the community and Daniel Brito, the Placements Manager, prepares your for your interviews leading up to the end of the bootcamp.Daniel Brito is invested in your time at the bootcamp and your time afterwards. I still go to him for questions and advice in regards to job hunting or interviews. I gained an internship as a Jr. Web Developer within 1 month of the program because of the confidence and tips I received from Daniel Brito and the team.

I haven’t written anything besides code in the past three months, and the longest piece of text I’ve typed recently was a string for a database. So how do I begin with this one…As a foreword of sorts, I didn’t know a thing about coding before... Read More I decided to apply for Ironhack’s Web Development Bootcamp. I had seen pieces of code before, and I could understand them just as well as ancient Egyptian. Until then, I had worked in the fields of journalism and communications, but if you have paid any attention to the world and its changes, you won’t need me to tell you about how hard it has become to make a career- and a living- in that sector nowadays.What I’m trying to convey is that, at first, coding was my Plan B, a way to escape unemployment and get back on track- but I had no idea if I could handle it, or if I was going to enjoy it at all. And (to my own surprise), not only did I make it, it also seems that I enjoy coding- although it still gives me the occasional headache. It might feel like I’m rambling, and I apologize- but there is a point in all of this. Like myself, many consider going into coding, but they wonder if it’ll be the right thing for them, if they will struggle trying to understand how code works. And I’ve come to find that you don’t require an intensive technical background to become a web developer or programmer. True, you need to tackle problems with a very different mentality compared to other trades, often needing to examine the task from every angle and understanding exactly what you will require, and what items will be involved, before you write the very first line of code. But once you adopt that mindset, code becomes less of a threat and more of a puzzle that challenges you and ignites your curiosity.Getting used to this new strategic, however, is just the first milestone that you will have to conquer. Our worst enemy during the bootcamp wasn’t Javascript, Angular or any other framework- it was frustration. The pace of the lessons rarely gave us time to catch our breath, and the daily exercises (both individual, and in pairs) would often test our limits. On a couple of evenings, I found myself with my head buried between my hands in a moment of panic, telling myself “I can’t do this, I wasn’t ready for something like this”, and I wasn’t the only one. If I’m painting a bleak picture so far, don’t worry- I’ve resorted to the “bad news, good news” mechanic to save the best for later. Although intensive, the bootcamp (divided in three ‘modules’ of three weeks each, with a final project at the end of each one) helped me understand the basics of code in a very comprehensive way, starting with basic exercises and steadily increasing the number of iterations or the challenge they offered. The bootcamp covers many areas that are key for a developer including Javascript basics and advanced features, layouts and design, database management and package management to expand the possibilities of our frameworks- and yes, all of that sounds like a lot at first glance, but again, even a complete newbie like me managed to successfully complete the bootcamp.Now, my classmates and I are getting ready for the hiring week. For some of them, this will be a ‘level up’ in their career; for others, this is the start of a new one, and although I still have much to learn, I feel prepared to walk into web development with my head up high. And in addition to this, my final project -a website for musicians to find one another and start new bands and projects- became more than just a task to deliver at the end, and I have decided to continue working on it. Who knows, I might be releasing my very own website, made on my own and from scratch, in not too long!Read Less",ironhack

This is because you are required to attend 2 weeknights from 6:30pm-9:30pm, and all day Saturdays (that's not including study and project time). Consider what it might be like for you to balance IronHack with a full time job. Apply as early as you can, as mandatory prework is assigned for you to complete before the start of the course. It helps get you familiar with the material and be prepared before your first day. I completed mine over the course of a month (a few hours here and there), totalling about 40 hours to finish. There are expenses that you will incur that are not included in your tuition:Be prepared to pay for parking, as the school is located in Brickell. Parking is located on the street (estimated $2/hour) or in a nearby garage (flat fee $10/day)Also be prepared to have about $300 extra saved to download the software you need or for miscellaneous items (Sketch, Flinto, and I am forgetting the others at the moment) $50 for a FOB, which is a key for 24 hour access. It gets reimbursed to you once you are done with the course.

Trust me if I say that the whole Ironhack bootcamp has been one the highest ranking experiences of my life. Let me explain you why.Coding is hard. Learning to code in 2 months is very demanding... Read More and does seem totally impossible. Believe it or not, the Ironhack campus in BCN is designed at every level (from the location, the building itself, the staff, the teachers, the syllabus, the events and the job opportunities) just to make that happen. It doesn't get more ideal than that. Let's address these points one by one.Location: Barcelona is one of the most international cities in Europe. You do breath modernity and opportunity here, especially in the Poplenou neighboroud where the campus is located. It has become a kind of tech district, so on the way to class you pass by real tech companies and it gives you a feel of where you might end up working. Feels like you're there already.The campus: Fantastic open space with glass walls (Kanban boards drawn on them), plants hanging from the ceiling, kitchen, showers, desks, standing desks and tons of architectonic eye candies. It's like your mind expands in there, and you're hooked. You don't want to leave. In fact you don't. You're given the keys and take advantage of the 24/7 access policy. You'll need it on project weeks!!The staff: They're doing a fantastic job at keeping the place so well organized YET very informal, frienly and welcoming. I felt like I could express myself without having to fit in to any particular mould, and that was very valuable to me, because during the bootcamp you are reinventing yourself and pushing your brain hard on coursework in order to do that. So nobody will judge you if you spend hours by a standing desk coding and dancing looking more like a dj (or a crazy person) than a developer. You're tired? You can take a nap in plain sight. Wanna play? Let's skate or play football, inside of course. Nobody will ask you to stop. The staff is committed in having you become a web developer. They know kicking a ball will help your unconcious brain solve the kata.The teachers: Andre has been one of the most inspiring and influential professional I ever met. The guy has more than 20 years of experience, and he knows how to deliver it to you. His technical knowledge is so intimate that I'm sure he natively thinks in Javascript then compiles in English for the rest of us. But it's not just that he tought us a programming language (and to love it), he focused a lot on best practices and the workflow and mindset you have to adopt in order to transform your ideas in to products through coding, and having fun in the process. Then, he passed on us so many insights drawing form his own experience, filtering out for us the most valuable. Maybe not obvious at first, but Andre insights sit on the brain and release value as time passes by. And also, it must be said: he let us appreciate how cool a fully fledged web dev can be. The teaching assistants: Ironhack employs the most suited students as teaching assistants for next cohorts. They're three, with different levels of experience depending on how many cohorts they survived. Yes, because it's not easy to stay patient having to debug horrible code by current students still not having a clue!! What you get from them is the closeness of relating with somebody who just finished the bootcamp, as well as accurate code revisions and debugging, directly from somebody who still remembers on what silly thing you're more likely to get stuck on. They were stuck there too just a couple of months before, they know how and where to help.The sillabus: Javascript is on fire nowadays and Ironhack is one of the few bootcamps to base its entire curriculum on it. Backend, frontend, all JS, because this is the present and the foreseable future of web dev. In fact, anything different would have felt like time wasting. The course is divided in three modules, each module giving you the teaching first and then challenging you on a project. The course material is constantly updated, you get exercises on a git repo to work on all night if you want. You'll get a detailed revision of your code in the morning. In the first module you learn the basics, HTML, CSS and JS, and make a late 90s style JQuerish app with it. Addictive brain gymnastics. Then you're introduced to Node.js in the second module, but server side. Mongo DB, Mongoose, Express. And you make a '00 style server rendered MVC app, which almost feels like a real thing. In the third module you're thought a Javascript framework (this time it was Angular 5), and are given two weeks to complete your own full stack project. At some point while doing it, which happens at different stages for different people, it's guaranteed that you will see the light. Like in the Karate Kid movie you'll see how all they made you do click together. Your fingers begin flying on the keyboard, translating your thoughts in to code as if it was the most natural thing in the world, while you wonder what the hell is happening. That's when a web dev has finally emerged from within you. Events and job opportunities: Each week we had at least a couple of talks by external speakers, giving us insights from within the industry. That has been very valuable, the best one was somebody explaining us how to make a bot using Dialogflow, with git repo and all. Fantastic. Unfortunately, you are likely to be very fatigued by all the mental work you're doing in the bootcamp to fully engage in the talks. But it is all meterial you can go back at a later stage, having had direct exposure to it, and maybe even networked with a real tech-industry specimen. And we came to job opportunities. I yet have to attend the hiring week which is organized at the end of the bootcamp and it's supposed to be a kind of speed dating between us graduate and tech companies. BUT, during the last event one of the speakers gained an interest in my final project and we're now exploring the prospect of remote work for his creative, amazing and well established start-up. So yes, nothing concrete yet but I can't beleive the fact I'm actively asked for interviews even BEFORE I start searching for a job. Amazing.Last point to address is the people. I barely been alone during these two months, the group spirit has been fantastic. From spending the night all together coding, to partying at campus on the weekends, I felt so fortunate to get to meet so many great people. On a personal note, that was even more important given the fact that I lost my father while I was attending the bootcamp. It wasn't an easy decision to stay and learn coding, but it was the right choice. The understanding and support I received from the staff and the other students has been invaluable, don't know what kind of place I would have been without it. I do reccomend the course, it delivers on expectations, but be ready to push yourself as hard as you can in the learning process. There's no magic, it all comes through hard work. Ironhack will provide you with the best environment, tools, knowledge, people, it's like a state of the art gym: the sweat is still all yours. As for me, I might take the UX/UI bootcamp, Ironhack is kind of addictive.Read Less",ironhack

Es el final del segundo módulo, tengo una sensación de tristeza porque queda una semana de clase y después el proyecto de 2 semanas, más cerveza y relajando motores porque el segundo módulo fue muy arduo y doloroso.Finalmente atacamos la tercera semana, sentimos como si nos estuvieran metiendo a presión deprisa y corriendo Angular sin ser capaces de entender que significa la palabra ‘reutilizable’ pero ahí estamos en una semana aprendiendo todo lo posible aplicando Passport a nuestro proyecto, juntando todos los conocimientos que tuvimos para dar a luz a un proyecto que representaría el top de nuestro aprendizaje dejándote el sudor y rezando para que no te salga un ‘unexpected token fatal error’, para una vez más presentar tu proyecto, recibir un aplauso y…se acabó.¿De verdad, y las vivencias, gente, profesores, amigos?Si te contase las picarescas y las vivencias tanto positivas como negativas, ¿vivirías realmente lo que tienes que vivir o intentarías vivir lo que yo te contase?Sólo te daré un consejo nuevo alumno, no tengas prisa después de la hiring week, tardarán en contactarte porque así funcionan las empresas, pero finalmente te aseguro que conseguirás esa meta ansiada como es la de conseguir un buen puesto de trabajo, palabra de ironhacker.Read Less",ironhack

I have met some truly incredible people (both staff and students) that have inspired me since day one to keep going.

In my case, not only were there 4 of them, but all four have insanely receptive qualities to make you feel comfortable enough to ask pretty much anything. Same goes for the rest of the staff.- on a professional level: perhaps the most important and differential factor, Ironhack has their own recruiter/laboral department that is commited to helping students find a workplace they'll enjoy once the 9 weeks are finished. May you find a job a week after finishing or not, they'll keep in touch with you (and I mean REALLY keep in touch, via slack or in person on a weekly basis) until you find something that fits you.On a final note i'd like to emphasize this: what YOU get out of Ironhack does not depend entirely and exclusively on them. It will also depend on the personal interest and motivation you have. The chance to network with hundreds of students from previous editions on a weekly basis is a fail-proof way to see that the model just works. It just depends whether you're compatible/comfortable with the idea of giving your 200% for 9 weeks of your life. Your previous experience (if any) does not matter.Read Less",ironhack

All right. I've been pretty excited to write this review. Honestly, these reviews were what helped me make a decision and although I’ve never written a review before for anything, I knew this one I had to write.... Read More I wondered what I would be writing once I finished the course; and I have to say that probably midway through the course I already knew: Just do it.  So, this review has two parts two it: Before Ironhack and During Ironhack. I wanted to give my story so that you have some context and maybe it’s similar to your own story and helps you make a decision. And if that doesn’t matter to you, then just scroll down to the second part :) BEFORE IRONHACK Upon my college graduation (earning a degree in communications — so not technical at all), I found a job for a small company located in a WeWork while still holding a part-time job at a restaurant. At WeWork, naturally, the job feed was filled with posts for developers. I saw how much opportunity there was and I decided to play around with programming with many of the free resources online. After realizing that it was something I could pursue professionally, I decided to quit my job at the small company so that I can work full-time at the restaurant and study so that I can become a developer. (Working for a restaurant is not as mentally strenuous as an office, so I figured I can at least make a living and study.) Fast-forward a year. I was still working at the restaurant and I was still studying. I missed my personal deadlines and extended deadlines before I thought going to a bootcamp would be a good choice. I was really reluctant to do a bootcamp because, honestly, the information is freely available out there so why should anyone pay for it. But I realized that the money that I would have saved by studying on my own, I already lost. If I had done the camp sooner, I could have had a job in tech sooner and I could have made back my investment already. Granted, some people can study this own their own and that’s awesome; I, however, am not one of these people. I could say that my only regret is that I didn’t do this sooner, but, honestly, I’m glad I ended up in the cohort I did because I met some amazing people that greatly impacted my experience.  DURING IRONHACK Oh man. The first week wasn’t bad. We went over material that I had covered on my own so I felt pretty confident. The week after that? Yeah, things got harder. What’s interesting about the experience is that some concepts will just click and you’ll feel good about what you learned that day. Other days, some concepts just won’t click and you’ll leave with a pounding headache and feeling defeated. But you’ll come back the next day. You’ll go over that concept again — while learning a new one — and you’ll keep doing that. Eventually, it just clicks — but I really have to give thanks to Nizar, our instructor, for helping that happen. Nizar knew our weak points and knew what he was going to have to go over and over again. Sometimes he sounded repetitive, but the man knew what he was doing. A little more about Nizar — he is an incredibly talented teacher. When you ask him questions, he won’t just give you the answer. He’ll guide you so that you arrive to the answer. And like I mentioned before, he knows students’ trouble spots. Sometimes he would jump through certain bits of the curriculum because he knew it would be better for our learning. He was even willing to give us extra time — during our final project week, we stayed with some of us until midnight helping put out all our fires. He didn’t have to do that. And I think the other amazing thing is that he was always encouraging you. He could tell that sometimes I would get frustrated, and he would just remind me kindly/matter-of-factly, “It’s going to get easier with time.” The rest of the staff at Ironhack is amazing too. They’re all so interested in making sure that you have the best possible experience; granted, it's in their best interest to put out the best quality product, but they work hard at it and they know you’re here to change your life and they don’t take that lightly. They do weekly surveys so that they can constantly improve. They don’t just treat you like customers but like friends, sharing with you about their lives and experiences. And overall, they’re just genuine people which adds positivity to the environment. Another staff member you’ll be interacting a lot with is Brito. He’s going to become more important later on in the course as you start getting ready to go to market. And, of course, he becomes really important as you actually go to market. The guy has a ton of connections (and he wants you to exploit them) and he is there to help you (and he will help you) — you just have to do your homework. (Some students got hired before we even graduated because of his contacts.) He is also the guy to tell it like it is — and that’s exactly what you want with someone who is supposed to help you land a job. Another amazing thing about Ironhack is the environment. But again, the environment is founded on the people. You get to go everyday to this awesome co-working space surrounded by like-minded individuals. People who have decided to make a change in their lives and just go for it. That momentum is was catapulted my learning. I had peers who I could turn to when I needed help or they turned to me for help. You have an amazing support group for when you’re down and wonderful people to laugh with when you need a little break when you’re staying until 10 or 11 pm coding away. It’s really hard to find that and Ironhack has found it. Overall, I wouldn’t trade my experience at Ironhack for anything. The environment is awesome, the staff is awesome, and the material is awesome. But the most important thing I learned (and I know you’ve already read this) is how to learn. Even with that year that I spent learning on my own and even taking a paid course at MDC, I learned more at Ironhack after the first week. This is just the tip of the iceberg and there is so much more to learn, but now I can build and learn while I do it. Do research, make a change, and give it your all. Wherever you decide to go - just do it.Read Less",ironhack

She is an influencer in the UX/UI design community and her ablity to inspire the class and instruct us in the techniques Ux'ers would need to be successful was inspiring. Maite always maintained a professional attitude and never displayed disappointment in the class or any student -she always maintained a sense of inspiration and the class responded to her instruction with universal admiration. If you sense a degree of admiration for her, I can assuredly state the admiration was felt by every student in our class- she was amazing in conveying the concepts that were new to us and ensured we fully understood the principles being taught. I can't say enough about the quality of education I received at Ironhack and it was the result of the superb instruction Maite conveyed. I would highly recommend Ironhack in an instant to anyone looking for a coding school or UX/UI design school- I can't imagine any school surpassing the standard the instrcutors and staff set at Ironhack- they are beyond reproach.Keri was the other part of the success myself and the other students achieved at Ironhack as she was the "teachers assistant" for our class. Keri teamed with Maite to form an unbeatable combination of class instruction........if any student needed clarification on any aspect of class instruction, Keri was always ready with a smile-never showing a hint of despair. The chemistry between Maite and Keri was a pleasure to experience as they formed an unbeatable teaching team. Keri displayed complete mastery of UX/UI design principles and eagerly helped at a moments notice, she clearly has the qulaities of a top level instructor.Brito is the "Placements Manager" and I've yet to see anyone more passionate about matching students with carreers. Brito is often found running around the school creating/maintaining contacts for carreer fairs to ensure every student has the maximum chance of successful job placement. He is a core component to student success with unmatched connections in the Miami tech industry and is highly regarded and respected. Brito always maintains a level of approachbility and availablity and is 100% committed to matching up students with the correct potential employers. Students normally interact with Brito near graduation time as he interviews every student and forms a relationship and pairs student traits to the best matching employers. He clearly takes great pride in his success rate in matching students to carreers and truly enjoys his role in student's success. The Ironhack staff was always courteous and approachable. The staff actually knows every student by name and always maintains a level of "friendship" that is difficult to describe. On 1st day of enrollment- the entire staff meets with all the students and engages in "name" games to enhance name recollection- this is an ingenious concept to student introduction and clearly works as the staff calls everyone by name! The school has a very 'informal- tech startup' feel which is likely intentional and helps foster an enviornement of learning and friendliness.The classroom environment also featured a "tech startup" feel with it's glass walls and sense of openess to staff and students alike. I would not change a thing to the learning enviornement, it was pleasing and provided a relaxed feel.My experience at Irohack was completely positive- the instruction and curriculum was flawless and the staff was always friendly. Ironhack sends weekly e-mail 'surveys' asking how they might improve the school or staff and it was difficult in making such recommendations. My suggestion was to add a "soda" machine to the upstairs kitchen as I don't drink coffee or beer!Ironhack is more than a school- it is a place where life-long friendships are formed and fostered. Both students and staff alike bond in a unique way I was not expecting and this sense was echoed by my fellow classmates. Ironhack is a place where lives are being changed and oppourtunities and dreams are being realized ..........I fully recommend this school and know anyone who enrolls will likely have the same experience and will be ready for their new carreer.So when you're ready to experience the most unque learning experience you'll ever engage in and ready to meet a super-friendly staff, enroll in Ironhack and get ready to be called by name.....I was beyond imprerssed and bet so will you!Get ready for a life-changing experience because I was not and I'm so glad I attended Ironhack.....new friends, experiences and careers are waiting!

Read More practiced design and web development on their own. Make no mistake, it can be done - but since I don't have a design background, I wanted a program that could guide my learning. But guess what - all of the other 8 students in the class had a design background of some sort and they found it worth to take the course as well.The thing about design is that it's more than just making something look good. It's about knowing how to solve a specific problem, applying best practices, AND making it look good. And you can't do that in a vacuum, you need others to critique your work, you need to know how to work with clients and you need to know how to work with developers. And that's what Ironhack exposes you too.Before taking the course I read reviews not just about Ironhack, but about coding and design bootcamps in general, and some of the reviews were pretty bad. Some said they didn't prepare you for an actual job in the real world, that they were just diploma mills and wanted your money. I can't speak for the other bootcamps out there, but Ironhack is ballin'.Finally, I am from Washington, D.C., relocating to Miami. Getting into Miami Tech seemed daunting; I didn't know anyone, didn't know what companies were hiring, didn't know any contacts. And now that I've just graduated, I can say while looking for a job is still a challenge, it is in no way daunting. I know my stuff and I know what's out there.About IronhackBefore applying for the course, I visited Ironhack and one other bootcamp in Miami in person. Ironhack is located at Building.co, a coworking space in Brickell (downtown Miami). Right now I'm typing this to you from the rooftop patio on the third floor. It's baller. More importantly, our classrooms are nestled in between real tech companies that occupy space in the building. At least once a week I run into the startup founder that won Refresh Miami's Tech Demo Day in October. I'm not just learning about tech, I'm bathing in it. Furthermore, the vibe here is just different. I feel like I'm wanted here, like I belong here. I've made what I think will be lifelong friends. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the staff here is just... the real deal. Really. And they're respected in Miami Tech - I know this from attending networking events and mentioning that I'm an Ironhack student. I've only gotten positive responses from saying that.Alia, the GM, personally called me to congratulate me on getting into the program. When my wife came to visit the course one day, she welcomed her as if she was another student. You can't fake that.Brito, the placements manager, is so well connected he probably knows Barack Obama and Obama doesn't even live in Miami. And he's sincerely interested in our success.Marisa, the program manager, and Pat, the admissions manager, are similarly supportive and friendly. And finally, for the UX/UI fulltime bootcamp this past fall, we had the most amazing Instructors, Maite and Kerri. Maite had done UX in Paris, London and I think New York and is world class. Seriously. She eats, sleeps, drinks UX. Like I'm almost worried for her sometimes that she needs to get to the beach more. :-) . She pushed us very hard to be our best, yet I knew every day she cared for us. You can't fake that.Keri, our TA, had completed the course previously and was the cheerleader we all need when completing a program like this. It's hard. If you give it the level of effort you need to be a great designer, it's even harder. And she was always there, answering our questions and encouraging us through frustration. In ConclusionI don't know what the future holds. There are no guarantees. I know it's hard out there. But as far as it relates to my professional life, where we all spend the majority of our days, I'm more hopeful than I've been in a long time.Whether you choose to do a bootcamp or not or Ironhack or not, if you're reading this I hope you find peace and meaning in whatever you do, and live courageously enough to work through fear and pain to better yourself and others."Don't ask what the world needs.

The reason I write the above first is because that is what I saw in several reviews I had read... Read More when searching for the right bootcamp. Yet, every time I would always think to myself, "Is that really the truth, though? Will I regret making the jump?" So before I write the rest of my review, I can tell you that those reviews were right!Before joining Ironhack, I was working at a digital marketing company in operations and product development (and before then I had just graduated with a bachelor in Architecture), so clearly I had zero coding experience prior to Ironhack. After about a year of debating whether I wanted to make a career change, I found Ironhack. I put my fear aside and reached out to ask for a campus tour here in Miami to get the ball rolling.Application Process: The first person I met at Ironhack was Alia, and Alia does NOT dissapoint! I felt such a great energy from her and genuine interest in getting to know me and understanding why I wanted to join their program. Shortly after, I applied and scheduled my three interviews (general interview with admissions, career interview with Brito, and a technical interview where you must solve a coding challenge). All three interviews went great (again...the only experience I had was working with developers, but never the actual coding aspect). The moment I received a phone call from Alia that I was accepted into the program I immediately felt two things: extreme excitement with a side of fear of "what did I just get myself into."Cohort (9 weeks): The structure of the class is exactly as they describe it on the site. Grab your coffee in the morning, learn, code, lunch, learn and code (did I mention the coffee is free and unlimited?!). What really made the course, though, was our instructor Nizar and we were so lucky to have him! The way he explains the concepts is very clear for the most part and, to someone with no coding experience, I was able to understand what he was teaching. He never says no when you need help, and what's great about it is that he doesn't just hand the answers to you. He makes you think about what it is you're doing and what you need to do to get there. Now, I'm not saying your journey will be easy, because it won't be. You need to put in the time inside and outside of class to make sure you're not falling behind. The course moves quickly, so it's very easy to fall behind if you're not keeping up. You will feel like (and I can only speak from the perspective of someone with zero coding experience), "Holy crap, there is an entire universe of coding that I did not know about," but don't get overwhelmed! Don't let it discourage you, but do expect to be learning for the rest of your life as we all know how quickly technology can change. Finding a job: Brito, the recruitment manager at Ironhack, is also someone you will meet and never forget. Keep in mind, he is not there to hand you a guaranteed job on a silver platter at the end of the cohort - and he will make that very clear. He does a great job of coaching you on what networking events you should attend, what you need in your LinkedIn and in your resume, and is available whenever if you have any questions or need help. There is also a hiring fair where companies come in to sit and interview with you, I have yet to experience it as our fair is not until January, but it's great to know that we get the opportunity (thanks to Brito) to have that chance of "speed-dating" with several companies who are looking to hire.Overall, my experience was amazing. I don't regret making the jump and am lucky to have been able to attend Ironhack. For the past 9 weeks it never felt like I was going to "school" and I was always excited to go in the next day to learn something new. The environment, staff and vibe of Ironhack was the cherry on top and I'm so glad that I chose to stay in Miami and attend their course. If you're reading this and you're still wondering whether you should apply....just do yourself a favor and do it already :).Read Less",ironhack

My professor was Nizar and he was extremely intelligent, kind, and was accessible at all times. The whole staff is. One of the cool things about Ironhack, is witnessing staff members like Nizar, Brito, and even guest speakers, just staying for hours after their shift ends to teach and talk more with fellow students… When you see these things, you come to realize that Nizar, Brito, the guest speakers, all help because they truly love their job. I think thats really the key difference your going to find, its like this perfect crew of people who love what they do, are passionate, and love playing a key role in helping others in their journey to success.

However, none of them gave me the same vibe that Iron Hack did. What do I mean by "vibe"? I mean that they actually cared about their students. Most of the other schools came across as simply trying to get me in the door, but Iron Hack literally took the time to sit with me, one-on-one, and very sincerely asked me "Why do you want to do this?" I gave my explanation as to why I wanted to do it and they proceeded to give me a detailed account of what my everyday schedule would be like and the amount of work that would be required of me if accepted. Every other school I visited would just give a generic "you can do it, just work hard!". The staff is unlike any other. Our Professor Nizar was basically, what I believe, every professor should be modeled after. This man would go out of his way to ensure that you understood what you were doing. He never simply gives you the answer, he works with you until you understand how to get the answer. He's also hilarious and made what might seem like a dull topic at times into something fun and interesting. Also, as part of the staff, you will have what is basically your guardian angel, Brito. You worried about getting a job after this bootcamp? Don't be. LISTEN TO BRITO. This man will not steer you wrong, and as long as you're putting in the work Brito is going to bend over backwards to make sure you find a job that is right for you.

However, it is not like what you are thinking, this is not a traditional college lecture or highschool classroom ( time flies by ). This is a new home and a new family. I think there was only one person in the cohort who had a degree related to computer science, other than that person, no one including myself had a computer science background. We still succeeded, in just 9 weeks we already had 3 projects under our belt and being able to do full stack apps on our own. Much of what makes Ironhack what it is, is how the faculty interacts with each other and with the students. Their work culture is so amazing, they have a special type of relationship, nothing like I have ever seen before. Of course this translates to the students. The staff develops a relationship with the students and in my opinion this improves experience so much.The learning doesn't stop there. At least for me, I took to learning other things during my free time. Things that weren't necessarily part of the curriculum, but I wanted to take advantage of having an instructor to which I could ask anything any time (literally any time. My instuctor would get back to me on Sundays! ). Ironhack gives you all the tools you need to succeed. From how to write amazing software, to what to say to future employers (more of this below). Like anything in life the you have to do the work, but my Ironhack family definitly made so much possible. The most important tool that I learned at Ironhack was how to "LEARN". You can't expect to become a the best developer in 9 weeks, but you can expect you will graduate with knowledge on how to become one! If you put in the work, I can guarantee you this. Nizar, our lead instructor is the man! The guy is legit one of the smartest people I've met, and one of the most patient as well! Trust me, dealing with me is no easy task. However, he was always there for me, and like I mentioned above, he even answered my questions on a Sunday. Rarely (very rarely) will he give you the answer to your problems directly, he does much more for you, he tells you how to be resourceful and where to look or something along those lines. You end up solving the problem on your own and because of this, you learn so much more. The whole teaching staff is amazing, Ironhack always have great T.A.s. Our T.A. Dappered dan was the man. He was also always accessible.The experience does not end there. At Ironhack, they have a placement manager. His name is Daniel Brito. What do you need to know? Brito is one of the most connected people I've ever met. Everyone in the South Florida Tech ecosystem ( maybe all of South Florida ) knows who Brito is. His background makes him the most qualified person for the role. His been on both sides of the table when it comes to hiring. If you decide to take the course, make sure you follow his every word. Why? Well I did, and I had a job before the cohort ended. He will also never write your resume for you or give you an answer directly, but you can expect the most detailed feedback you could ever imagine. He knows exactly what employers look for and will get you to where you need to be if you put in the work!I can comfortably say Ironhack that has changed my life and I am very grateful for this!Read Less",ironhack

Events were organised regularly to get to know different parts of the Tech sector and life as an engineer, as well as to party and have fun with other students - there are always an ample supply of beers available for students to enjoy after classes.In terms of value, Ironhack was the best educational experience I've had (for comparison I have degrees from Oxford, University of Edinburgh, IE University in Madrid)I received 5 interview job offers before the Ironhack hiring day the following week, and several more at the hiring day. In terms of salary from low to high these were between a job as a front-end developer start-up in Barcelona for €20,000, a full stack engineer in an established international company in Barcelona at €30,000 a year or at a Dutch company in Amsterdam for €50,000. All with ample opportunities to learn. In terms of working as a freelancer, I was also contacted by a UK agency offering 300GBP a day to work as a remote developer. As I said above, I worked one of the highest in my cohort - those who put in similar efforts saw similar rewards though.You'll learn skills which will help you your entire life, especially how to learn new technologies: in the four weeks after finishing I built applications with Ruby on Rails and Elixir/Phoenix, as well as using Javascript Libraries and frameworks I'd never even heard of during my time in Ironhack. Ironhack is not perfect. Don't come if you expect perfection; come to learn how to deal with real life situations. Sometimes the content is outdated --- just like happens in every programming job --- programming language change; sometimes things don't happen as expected; learn to deal with it. That's real life. The only thing I would say does not reflect real work is the lack of attention to testing. I don't think the importance of testing was impressed upon us - certainly in my cohort the one module that related to testing was treated as optional/an annoyance, and we were never taught principles of TDD or who to write a test. If it were up to me, I would have at least one of the portfolio projects have a small scope, but by developed through TDD. I think students would find more, and better paying jobs and ultimately be better developers because of it.Read Less",ironhack

I had reached a point... Read More where I was tired of working stagnant retail and call center jobs, and wanted to see if I could really turn my hobby into a career.Shortly after moving to Florida, I had been told about Ironhack from a friend and figured I may as well apply. Alia had contacted me back within about 15 minutes, and I was scheduled to come in a few days later. The interview process was not complicated, and the staff I spoke with did a great job of outlining the program. My biggest concern was that without having a college degree, and without any previous work experience, that a program like this still wouldn't help me, however Daniel Brito did a great job of explaining how to work around those things. I had also been doubting that I would have the bare minimum skill needed to pass the technical interview, which ended up going well (So don't doubt yourself on this!).  From the very first week, week 0, I decided I would start showing up to finish up some of the online prework that was assigned before the course started, this was the first time I met Kevin, on of the TAs, who was very friendly, and had a manner of encouraging learning without just handing you answers.  After the first week started our primary instructor Nizar gave us a run down of what our schedule was going to look like, and I'll admit it was intimidating. Nizar however, had a manner of teaching that made the fact that we were learning a LOT more enjoyable than stressful. In addition to that, the TAs Kevin and Ariel both out host break-out sessions throughout the week to focus on different concepts that some were struggling with, and held these sessions in a way that students would also be able to participate. To compliment the technical side of learning the skills needed to become a software developer, Daniel Brito also regularly would teach us the Ins-and-Outs of the career side: Networking skills, community events, resume building, etc. and this was something that was very unique and welcomed. I had expected this to be like most traditional schools where they will teach you skills and concepts, but will leave you on your own when it comes to getting employed for those skills. This also brought about the possibility of learning beyond the scope of the Ironhack curriculum, as we were actively encouraged to attend events and meet people in the tech scene who were established developers, entrepreneurs and startup founders who also were willing to share their knowledge, some working in the same building as Ironhack was located.  Now with all those "pros" being said, it should be noted that while not exactly a "con" there are some things to keep in mind: They call this a bootcamp, and that is a very accurate word to describe it. It's not easy, but it's not impossible either. Unlike traditional schooling, you wont get a degree for simply showing up and goofing off. We had to do projects that applied everything we learned, and the time given to complete these project was 1 week, and then they had to be presented to both the class, and occasionally other people who were in the building. Before Ironhack, I had written some scripts and small programs for fun, but they were never seen by anyone, and now I had to not only show it to my instructors, but to several people?! It stands as one of the most stressful things that I would gladly do again. What was great about this though is that it conditions you for what is expected of you in the industry, and by the end, these presentations were more fun than stressful. Ultimately Ironhack teaches you how to stand on your own in a relatively new and rapidly changing industry, and teaches you how to continue teaching yourself long after you leave the program, so that your skills will stay competitive. Nizar is a master of both writing code, and teaching it. Kevin and Ariel were great at encouraging us when we got stuck or stressed out, and also making things fun. Daniel Brito will make you into a rockstar when it comes to networking, job hunting, and building a presence for yourself in the tech community of your choice. Thanks to the well crafted curriculum, and the great staff, I've now gone from a guy who had moved from working in aerospace to working at grocery stores and call centers, who wrote simple programs on the weekend for fun, to a Full Stack .Net Developer at a company who's 2 week development sprints are a walk in the park compared to the 1 week high-pressure sprints for Ironhack's projects.If you are on the fence about whether or not you should attend a program like this, and are serious about becoming a web developer by profession, then this program can change your life.Read Less",ironhack

I wanted to be able to build applications to help my teams and clients, and knew that I had enough curiosity and perseverance to actually likely make it happen.This bootcamp is no walk in the park. I quit my job, didn't go out with friends, and focused as much of my energy as humanly possible on grasping the changing concepts. Each day we had a morning lesson, exercises, an afternoon lesson, and then a night project. While instructors did help those in the class that were falling behind, the class moves fast and you have to give it your all to progress. The instructors were not only an intelligent, hardworking group, they took care of each question that came about, and often stayed after hours to help with projects, going far above and beyond. The classmates were a driven bunch. It was exciting seeing each person, coming from vastly different backgrounds, excelling and struggling at different stages.After the bootcamp, we all make one final application during a 2 week sprint, and then present these to Ironhack and the community, a group of maybe 80-100. Afterwards networking happens and then its on you! I found a full stack web developer role a few months after graduation, through a recruiter friend of mine from back home. This did require me moving back to Philadelphia from Miami, which was a little sad but it is a reality. Please don't assume that you will immediately find a job right where you studied, you may have to pick up and move to find something!In conclusion, I highly recommend the Ironhack experience. You will learn the basics of full stack web development. You will learn how to make real, production applications.

True, the learning process is exhilarating at times and painful at other, but always keep the faith that with time and practice you will progress, understand and succeed. A bootcamp can fit many profiles from total newbies (as the former me) to people with some knowledge of computer science or that have already dabbled with programming. Hence, our cohort was quite heterogeneous in terms of levels and goals, but it created a healthy emulation where co-students and assistants were always supportive to students that were most challenged.Ultimately, as a student I am amazed by how much we have learned and achieved in a span of only 9 weeks. Yet, it is also very humbling to realise that there is still so much more to learn and that some advanced topics are just out of the reach of jr. devs. One thing I realised as well, is that programming is a craftsmanship that requires hours upon hours of practice and hands-on experience and no one can become a programmer overnight. Nevertheless, a bootcamp is simply the perfect kick-starter that will provide you with the basic skillset to be able to learn by yourself. Note that If your goal is to be recruited as a jr. dev after the bootcamp, which ws not my case, I strongly recommend that you enter the bootcamp as much prepared as possible (do online tutorials, watch YT vids, check as many resources as possible etc.).In a nutshell, I can assert that thanks to IronHack I have grown from code illiterate to code literate, which is truly life-changing.Hats off to the staff for, although we were only the second Parisian cohort, the bootcamp was already a fine-tuned machine very well connected with the French tech ecosystem.

I enrolled with the intent... Read More to only further my skills as a developer and put myself in a better position to enter the market as a professional but I walked away with so much more.Anyone throwing around the idea of joining a coding bootcamp has to do their due diligence and really be sure that they get all the information they can on the camp before committing. So as an alumni I am putting myself back in the shoes of a prospective student and will shed light into some of the pressing questions that are sure to be on the mind.Investment: Any coding camp is going to be a sizeable investment in not only money but time as well. Anyone who is toying with the idea of getting into coding and has not yet attempted to learn on their own is running the risk of losing on this investment. A prospective student should be absolutely sure that a coding camp is the right choice for them because the last thing you want to do is be tippy toeing around the idea of a life as a developer only to have gone through the bootcamp and realize that maybe it wasn’t all that you built it up to be in your mind. Look at all of the free resources (Google, YouTube, etc.) and at least attempt to learn on your own beforehand. A career in development is one that involves life long learning so I have to emphasize that you ask yourself if you are considering this bootcamp for the right reasons (i.e. genuine love for development and not the money chase).Curriculum: Ironhack is constantly keeping an eye on market trends with regards to the skills employers want in to see in Junior Developers. In 2017 they decided to take the web development curriculum from one that was Ruby centric to one that teaches Full Stack Web Development (MEAN) with Javascript. This right here is big because it makes you more attractive in the eyes of potential employees as the demand for these skills high and you are given the foundation to go off and build the next big application or at the very least understand how the most popular applications (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.) are built.Course Instruction: Nizar Khalife (Lead Instructor for full time Web Development course) is an experienced developer with real world experience who has a wealth of knowledge and is more than willing to share it if you are willing to receive it. He Knows the material like the back of his hand and you are going to wish that you had more than 9 weeks to pick his brain to extract all of his wisdom.Career Placement: Daniel Brito (Placements Manager) is someone who you need to have as a professional contact as he knows just about everyone in the Miami Tech scene. He worked many years as a Senior IT recruiter so he knows exactly what employers are looking for in Junior Developers. He is also someone who will bend over backwards for you by not only placing employers in front of you but will also show you how to hustle your way into generating quality leads for yourself. His career services are invaluable and are not to be underutilized. Networking: Aside from technical skills, there is networking aspect that launches you right into the heart of the Miami Tech scene. Ironhack has been able to build relationships with major companies and industry leaders that you can easily leverage once you are a member of the Ironhack family; student or alumni. If landing a job as a developer after taking the course is your goal (which it should be), skill alone will not get your foot in the door (unless you are gifted with genius level abilities). You also have to network and make yourself be known in the eyes of the community and Ironhack is your ticket into it.Daniel Brito and Nizar Khalife are invaluable resources that make Ironhack what it is and make worth the cost of the bootcamp. However, they are not alone in making Ironhack the machine that it is. The rest of the staff are an absolute joy and you will never feel like you are just another dollar in the pockets of another organization. Everyone is extremely hands on and will go above and beyond to ensure that your experience is one that promotes your success.In my eyes, Ironhack is by far the best coding camp in South Florida that provides you will all the tools and resources needed to get a return on your investment.Read Less",ironhack

This is not an exaggeration. I chose computer engineering as my major in college to make my parents proud; however, computer... Read More engineers are about signals and circuitry, and I could not see myself pursuing a career revolving around this. I spent 2 years stumbling to find a passion, and eventually, I found it in coding.As a disclaimer, prior to the bootcamp, I gain some coding experience from college, and while unemployed, I attempted to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript basics through online resources, but I felt like my learning was sporadic and unstructured. I attempted to apply for programming jobs for six months, but after about 90 job applications, no one reached out to me. I felt discouraged, but I knew I needed to find guidance. Ironhack provided this guidance.The 9-week course was fast-paced even for a person with some coding background, so I strongly encourage students with no experience to learn basic JavaScript prior to the start date. The teacher, Nizar, was able to break down complex concepts into simple examples and analogies making them easier to understand. He also provided step-by-step implementation for web application examples. Each day, there are periodic breaks between lessons, so he and the TA can assist us throughout the class; therefore, everyone remains on the same page.The three projects at the end of each module were great opportunities for all of us to shine. I felt proud of my projects since the ideas came from myself, and I was the one (with some existence) who needed to break them down into coding solutions. Having a project at the end of each module helped solidify the skill sets learned in the current section and build on the previous skills. These projects were done in a short span of time (as short as one week) forcing us to learn project management skills.I had one issue that frustrated me and other students during project week. The length spent troubleshooting problems for individual students were far too long. Sometimes one student would take one or two hours of the teacher’s time fixing a feature while there was a queue of other students waiting for assistance. Because of this, during the final project week, I spent a lot of time troubleshooting issues on my own, and I was unable to complete most of the features in my project.After graduation, career week followed, and those seven days were very helpful. I learned strategies for job hunting, and I realized that those six months of no-follow-up job hunting was due to poor tactics. Our advisor, Brito, made sure to have multiple companies at our hiring fair. The hiring fair reminded me of speed dating where you only had twenty minutes per company! It was stressful and excited at the same time. From this hiring fair, I received 3 interviews, and I got an offer 2 weeks later. I am now an associate software engineer making twice as much money as I did a year ago, and honestly, I am excited about my career path as a developer.Read Less",ironhack

Read More opportunity to learn a high-paying, technical skill in 9 weeks and get a job doing what you love. This opportunity, however, is only available to those who are willing to put in the work. Before I joined Ironhack, I was worried that no matter how hard I worked, I wouldn't be prepared because maybe the curriculum was teaching the wrong skills, maybe the bootcamp didn't have strong business relationships in the community. I was proven wrong. Ironhack has far exceeded my expectations.The InstructorOur instructor in Miami was Nizar. This guy will go above and beyond to make sure you understand everything that is being taught.I learned from him in 9 weeks what would've took me a whole year to do by myself. He will spot bugs in your code so quickly it'll make you feel stupid. But this is good, because he will get you from point A to point B much faster. He's half the reason why you're paying $10,000. The more questions you ask, the more you bug Nizar before class and after class with questions, the more you'll understand, and the more money's worth you'll get from this bootcamp. And Nizar will always be willing to help.The Placements ManagerThis is where the other half of your money is going. If you put in the work, this man will get you a job. They call him the plug in the Miami tech community, but we call him Brito. During my cohort, this man managed to invite 17 companies to the hiring fair. Not only that, he's got connections in tech companies you've never even heard of. He works his ass off for you to get a job. And that's exactly what you want. He'll help you with your resume, on your job search, on building a network, on getting to the right person in the right company... Anything you can think of during the job search, this man got you covered. The StaffEveryone at Ironhack is on your team. Everyone is family there. Anything you need, they got your back. The most impressive thing to me is how they ask for your feedback on the class every single week. They sit down with you if you have any compliants and they really make you feel like they care. I believe that with every year, each cohort will get better and better.Warnings before you apply:No one is there to hold your hand. If you slack off, no one gives a damn. You're just competition to everyone else in your class for the same jobs. If you join, make sure you love to code. Make sure you're willing to commit at minimum 12 hours a day to the bootcamp. Make sure you're willing to continue to work without anyone looking over your shoulder.If you join, aim to be in the top 10% of the class. That's the only way you'll be in demand. Do the pre-work. Master the basics, and get a head start in the class. Built connections with people. Go to events, speak up at talks, ask great questions. The connections you build in this cohort will last you a lifetime. Ironhack changed my life, and if I knew how much value they provided, I would've gladly paid double for the tuition. Ironhack gives you the opportunity to be rewarded for your hard work. And you will be rewarded.If you're not ready to work hard and make sacrifices, you're wasting your time.Read Less",ironhack

I first delved into the world of computer programming a few months before, but there seemed to be too much material and no structure.

Ironhack gives you the means to learn by yourself.2. The course is very particularized, and you are given support and close feedback. After all, they have a ratio of 1 teacher for every 8 iron hackers.3. The iron hack community. Ironhack is an experience which transcends education and it certainly does not finish after the bootcamp ends. Not only does it offer a hiring week, increasing the probability of finding a job, but you form a growing community of Ironhackers, with extensive knowledge in all areas of software development.Beware, It is no an easy experience. In the 9-week-long course you will face frustration in all its shapes and forms. However, would it be worth it if it wasn’t so demanding?

Here’s the TL;DR of my review of Ironhack in bullet points, but I highly encourage you to read the rest of the post if you’re... Read More considering attending this bootcamp and want to get an unfiltered and real opinion from a recent grad who now works full-time as a Software Engineer.First and foremost, if you’re going to go into the web dev program, it absolutely has to be because you feel genuinely passionate about this field and working as a developer one day. If you’re doing this for money, you’re doing it for the wrong reason and at some point during the program you will realize you hate what you’re doing and you wasted $11K.Daniel Brito (placements manager) and Nizar Khalife (head instructor for the full-time class) are absolute gold and two people you will learn a ridiculous amount of great things from. Without a doubt, these two guys alone are worth the cost of the Bootcamp and, quite frankly, without them Ironhack Miami wouldn’t be as solid. Listen to them, let them guide you, they do know what they’re doing. The rest of the staff are also very nice and friendly people.Remember that no bootcamp is some sort of magical experience — the end result and your overall success in it really boils down to the amount of effort that you put in. And you have to put in more effort than probably any other endeavor you’ve taken on in your life. This is no exaggeration. Everyone’s lives are different, but do whatever you can to enroll in the full-time cohort and not the part-time. Doing this stuff full-time ensures you will be significantly more focused and with less distractions. Trust me, this is critical.To elaborate some more, Ironhack is a great experience that will without a doubt push you to your limits and make you feel outside your comfort zone almost constantly. This is a good thing, and it also means that the more passionate you are about being a developer, the more you will learn and the less frustrated you will feel when you don’t understand something. One way to know if you enjoy doing this stuff every day is to prep yourself before you decide to enroll (lots of free resources out there, Google it). You do that by making a daily schedule (as in, 5-7 days a week) where you spend at least a few hours each day learning to code and problem solve using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS on your own. Keep this up for a few weeks and you’ll get a better idea as to whether this is something you’d enjoy doing as a full-time job or not. If you walk into Ironhack with that level of commitment, you will definitely do well and you will also get along super well with Brito and Nizar. Brito in particular is someone who knows almost everyone in the tech community in South Florida, and he's also a great guy to talk to. He’s the person who will bend over backwards for you to help you find a job, help you grow your professional network, and give you all sorts of actually useful advice (no fluff or BS) on anything from job hunting, to résumé building, to how to talk to potential employers. But this is only going to happen if you’re dead serious about the program and finding a job afterwards. He is NOT there to do the work for you, you first gotta put in the effort, you gotta hustle, and you gotta love what you’re doing. Nizar is the one other person you want to listen to and learn from. The man has a substantial amount of real developer experience and the ability to almost glance at a problem and tell you what’s wrong with your code and what you can do to fix it. He’s also extremely patient and very good at helping you understand abstract concepts. Overall a fantastic instructor.All in all, this is the best bootcamp in South Florida, by a long shot. Ultimately, it’s up to you and no one else how successful you are in the program and whether you find a job at some point later. Brito and Nizar are priceless. And if you like what you read in this review and are willing to work really hard, then don’t waste any time and reach out to Ironhack!Read Less",ironhack

It’s who you know and how they see you in terms of your personality, drive, and ability to learn (for which your skillset serves as evidence).

When I was drawing the lines, the period I was in the bootcamp was one of the most fulfilling periods in my life, really close to 10, both in happiness and personal achievement. I had to work my ass off to get in, because it is not cheap, and I risked a lot by joining: if it failed I would have been in the shit. But it passed with flying colours. The stack you learn (MEAN) is really good, the materials were really good and comprehensive. The course is REALLY REALLY HARD. Very high paced, even if you have previous experience. So you'll get frustrated, tired, crazy. I would have liked to learn React more than Angular, but still it was good. Two of the teachers my cohort had were really good, and the third one was mindblowing, but we only had him for a week :( Overall, they were really good, patient and always willing to help, but they have to cover a looooooot of content in a really short time, so it is difficult for them, as they can not take the time they would like to to go over some concepts.More than the teachers, for me the incredible part was the other students, the teacher assistants and some other people from the staff. For me, the TAs are the real heroes here. They do the grunt work, they handle our complaints, frustrations, limitations, help us with code and with handling the pressure. And the colleagues I had, I have only love for them. They were all amazing, driven, empathetic, funny people. I miss them a lot. At one point, a crazy CEO with a biotech startup came into my bootcamp looking for developers. I really, really wanted that job, but they were not looking for juniors. I persisted, and at some point they sent me this crazy technical test in Groovy and Grails, that I had never heard of before. I managed, and not only because of my effort, but because my friends there, the TAs and some other staff members encouraged me so much. I felt so supported and so happy. If I had tried that alone, I would have given up. So yes, I got the job one week before my final project, and here I am, in a biotech startup in London as I wanted.And all because I was there with that big 'family', where I was able to achieve way more than I could normally achieve. They make you believe in yourself, in your abilities. Also that has a special value if you are a woman in tech. They push you a lot, the contents are too much and you think you can not manage, but you feel so comfortable that you end up managing. You grow like crazy in such a short period of time you don't even believe it was possible. I can not guarantee that your experience there will be as fulfilling as mine. I consider myself extremely lucky with all the amazing people that converged in my cohort. But if you don't get a community as excellent, at least the technical knowledge you'll gather will be really solid and good. You'll gain or improve the abilities of sharing, helping, communicating, dealing with frustration, solving problems. And they really help you with intros and contacts if you want them, it shouldn't be too difficult to get a job after the bootcamp. I even got one before finishing the bootcamp!Read Less",ironhack

An intense 6-month zero-to-hero program for anyone wanting to open their mind to the exciting world of web development.My initial knowledge of the technology stack in the curriculum... Read More was basically null, but I was starting a position as Software Engineer at an up-and-coming startup in Madrid, and I needed to learn as much as I could as fast as I could. Ironhack proved to be just the right thing for me. For the sake of organizing the review, I'd like to split it in three parts: the Curriculum, the Experience, and the Staff.1. The CurriculumI do not want to get too deep into this because it has changed quite a bit since I did the course. My class was the last of the Ruby on Rails Generation. Nonetheless, the course was generic and conceptual enough that using other technologies, such as Node.js in my case at work, proved to be quite easy. They have since changed their curriculum to Node.js, which is a great idea in my opinion. You will come out having a broad enough knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to be able to tackle the coolest web-dev projects you find on Github and, as well as a great notion on working with databases. You will definitely have the skillset necessary to build your own projects from scratch as well. I think the best way to define the learning process at Ironhack is that you gain the ability to explore and master the tools you need to build a web application. The stack they may use is no limiting factor. In essence, you get the wings you need to fly on your own through the web-dev universe.2. The ExperienceIt's intense. Even the part-time plan is challenging and demanding. For 6 months you will have to be strongly committed to the course, because how much you learn will depende entirely on you. Ironhack will provide the tools you need to get as far as you want to go, but the effort has to be there. The pacing is neither too fast, nor too slow, although you do have to work at home a bit if you want to keep up. If you come from a totally different background, or are writing your first lines of code, you'll probably need to work harder than people who are more familiar with code. But fear not, you will have awesome support from your classmates and teachers. You will be spending two days from 18 to 21, and Saturdays from 9 to 17 at Ironhack, so be prepared. Balancing the course with a full time job and your personal life is definitely possible, but you will certainly need the willpower to do it. The structure has changed since I did the course, I believe now it is more project based (three projects in total), and at the end you get to share your creations with your mates and with people from all over the community that come to the Hackshow. 3. The communityThis is, in my opinion, the greatest value in Ironhack. You will make great friends with your teachers, you will make great friends with your classmates, and will live an amazing experience carefully crafted by the entirety of the Ironhack team. You will be connected to the community before, during and after the course. There will be lunches, dinners, parties, hackshows, hackathons, talks and so much more to make the Ironhack experience that much more enriching. Every member of the Ironhack family, not just the teachers, is there to make the most of the program for the students, and it really shows. Also the space they have in Madrid is beautiful, making it a pleasure to go there work and spend time.Overall a great experience that I thoroughly recommend to anyone that want to dig into the world of app-building - whether you are thinking of a cool project, want a career change, or work in product and want to understand what the devs at your work do. Ironhack is sure to satisfy your curiosity.Read Less",ironhack

At the time, I was preparing to go to law school, but once I realized it wasn’t the right fit I had to re-group and figure out my next steps. I was working a very boring job in retail for about... Read More 8 months before Ironhack, so obviously I was eager to get started. I did a ton of research before committing. Needless to say, for many prospective students it can be daunting to put a pause on your career to take a risk on a bootcamp that may or may not live up to your expectations. In my first two rounds of interviews, Alia and Marisa immediately quelled these anxieties. The amount of care that the Ironhack staff puts into each cohort is unrivaled. Something I really admire about them is that they’re always working to improve the next cohort based on what they learned from the last group. The course was split up into the steps of the design thinking process, with a new instructor each week. 1 design sprint, 1 group project and 2 solo projects. This stood out to me in comparison to other design programs because it gives you the opportunity to show off the work you can do on your own as well as what you can contribute to a team. At one point you’ll be working on two projects at once (group and individual), but it’s very manageable. (My advice would be to document everything along the way via Medium posts so that you’re not scrambling at the end to put together your portfolio.) Our TA Horacio was always available to help us through any road blocks we hit along the way. Your cohort will be your greatest support system and will challenge you to work harder and smarter.  For hiring week, Brito gave us a choice of 15 employers to interview with. It’s up to you to choose the companies you want to sit down with, but I would highly recommend interviewing with as many as possible. Not because you’ll get a job out of the hiring fair, but because the interview practice you’ll get is an invaluable experience. Don’t worry about wasting the time of employers that you’re not serious about because several of the companies that came in during our hiring fair immediately told us they weren’t hiring. Regardless, the experience made me a pro at interviewing and gave me the confidence I needed to succeed in my interviews that followed. Even if you don’t get hired immediately, Brito makes it his mission to get you a job. I really appreciated all his support and advice throughout the job search process. He’ll help you through the gritty details of negotiating offers, writing follow up emails, and anything else you need to know along the way. He’s an invaluable resource, listen to him! I accepted an offer 3 weeks after my program ended. I couldn’t have done it without the support and care of Alia, Marisa, Danny, Brito, Horacio, and the rest of the amazing staff, instructors, and TAs at Ironhack. That said, you will not get a job just by taking this course. Work hard and listen to the advice from Brito, your instructors, your mentors, and even your classmates. “If you’re empathetic by nature, and you have a head for problem solving, along with a thorough understanding of general design principles and processes, a healthy combination of functional and aesthetic sensibilities, a willingness to learn, and you enjoy the work, there’s absolutely no reason you can’t quit your shit job as soon as possible, so that you might do what you were really born to do.”Read Less",ironhack

I needed to add to my portfolio, tighten up my design skills, and meet more people in the industry.I knew I needed further education, but the question was what program or school could offer the results I needed in the fastest amount of time possible? Before I make any big decisions I research the heck out of everything, comparing, contrasting, emailing past clients or students in this case, and asking everyone I could on what they thought of the program I would be spending a good chunk of money on. I researched design programs in Atlanta, Chicago, and Texas, speaking with their advisors and asking a multitude of questions. None though were as genuine, honest, and optmistic as Alia Poonawala from Ironhack. I placed my application on a Monday morning, she called me the following Tuesday morning, requesting I come into a meeting later that day. She answered all my questions, even allowing me to briefly meet Daniel Brito, the Ironhack Placements manager and one of the most genuine/well connected humans I have ever met.I accepted the offer from Ironhack two days after the meeting, quit my job, and began my UX/UI journey for the next 3 months.The friends I've made, students, mentors, and industry professionals, was something that I did not expect. THIS IS NOT ANTOTHER DESIGN MILL CHURNING OUT STUDENTS PEOPLE. This is a real community of designers, developers, and creative professionals coming together to help each other be the best they can be.The instructors who taught the course varied in design expertise, but all truly cared about your sucesss. They provided revelant design skills, insights, and mentorship, allowing me to learn about things that have helped me succeed as a professional today. Now I do reccommend that you consider the amount of time you want to put in here. What you put in as far as questions and extra practice is all up to you and will benefit you if you allow it to. They will give you the water but it is your decision to drink, so to speak. The course is broken up into different parts of the design process, for different weeks, and this allowed us to really deep dive into the specific designs skills that we needed.Professionally, the course also provided resume/portfolio advice, mock interviews, and branding guidance. They teach you skills as a designer but also prepare your brand to be competitive in this field. This is something that places Ironhack a notch ahead of other schools.Upon hiring week, yes they have a hiring week, I interviewed with 12 potential companies, gainining 3 job offers and accepting one offer for a well-paid consulting gig. Now, like I mentioned previously, you have to listen to what Daniel Brito, the hiring manager, says to a tee, he is an industry expert and will give you the best advice if you listen. You also have to put in the time during/after class to sharpen you skills and listen to the design instructors, they will not give you the job you have to honestly work for it.Overall the most important thing I learned from this course, besides the many design skills, was that you can accomplish anything if you truly put your mind to it. My class consisted of students from all types of backgrounds, biology, anthropology, I came from psychology and digital marketing. But we all gained enough valuable skills and contacts in the field to accomplish our goals, whatever that was to each individual.

I accepted this opportunity with pleasure, having done tutoring in the past, and as I found Ironhack to be a productive and fun environment.A few good points about the course, from a mixed perspective of a former student and a current team member:As a student, I found the Ironhack team to be personal, accessible and dedicated to its students. The general manager and all the other staff were always a room away, and ready to greet anyone with kindness and a positive change attitude. Having researched the market a bit, and consulting friends who are experienced developers, the curriculum learned in the course seems to be extremely relevant to the current ecosystem. As a team member, I notice the effort we make to constantly adjust the course as needed. This is a regular mission, as technologies change, trends come and go and the market shifts. However, beyond the specific technologies learned, the most important skill I gained during this bootcamp was the conceptual understanding of the process and architecture of a full-stack project. For instance, a strong focus was understanding what APIs are, how they are designed, and how they serve as a kind of language to interact with data. Understanding and practically implementing such modern web dev concepts are indispensible in becoming a developer yourself.I now feel confident starting my career as a web developer, and so I can recommend this experience for whoever is in a similar situation.Read Less",ironhack

As I coded on my own, I would often find myself getting stuck, frustrated, and not knowing where to turn. After research and visiting several bootcamps in... Read More the Miami area, I decided to attend Ironhack for the full time web development course. One of the key factors in my decision was the desire to learn Javascript and the MEAN stack, since I knew they are popular and in-demand technologies of the web and Ironhack had recently re-vamped their curriculum to reflect that.The staff at Ironhack is like a family; they do everything they can to make students feel a part of that family, as well as a part of the Miami tech scene. Marisa, Danny, and Alia are always checking in to make sure you feel supported and are adjusting well throughout the course. Nizar, the lead instructor, is awesome! Not only is he a smart, experienced teacher and a Javascript wizard, he’s also extremely helpful and humble. He is very patient and takes the time to break everything down so you truly understand the concepts, whether it is as a class, or one-on-one. He supports his students, giving them the confidence and tools to succeed in anyway he can. He gets to class early, stays late, and gives 110% every day. The TA’s at Ironhack, Kevin and Ariel, are former graduates of the program. They are very knowledgeable and help support the students since they have been through the bootcamp experience themselves. Instead of just telling you how to solve whatever you may be having difficulty with, they help guide you to the solution so that you can really think like a programmer. If you are really stuck, both Kevin and Ariel do a great job of reinforcing key concepts.Daniel Brito, the placements manager is one of the most passionate people I’ve had the pleasure of meeting. If you are seeking a job after graduation, Daniel is one of the most powerful weapons in your arsenal! He is a networking guru in the Miami tech scene and has the top players come in to speak to the class. He constantly encourages you to have “no chill” and will work hard and fight for you so long as you put in the work.The most important things I gained from attending Ironhack are learning programming and knowing where to turn when I got stuck. Ironhack taught me the foundations of web development and skills that I can transfer as I learn new programming languages and grow as a developer. I was able to get a full time job as a developer a little over a week after graduation, and I can truly say Ironhack has helped me change my life!Now you might be reading this and asking yourself, "so this sounds great, but what's the catch?". There is no catch, but don't be fooled into thinking this course is easy. The amount of information you learn and the speed of the course is very intense. You have to put in a lot of time and effort into every aspect, both inside and outside of the classroom. There will be days where you're exhausted, you want to slam your head against a brick wall in frustration, and your code just won't work. But if you work hard, trust the process, and seek support, you will finish the course in disbelief with what you've accomplished in such a short time.Read Less",ironhack

A week and a half after Ironhack ended, I had two full-time job offers to become a Web Developer. Now, it's not a magic wand, that will automatically give you a job. You have to work for it, and you have to love what you do. It is an intense course.The intensity of the course, did teach me one of the most important things, when becoming a developer, and that is how to learn. The tech industry is constantly changing, and since the course is very fast pace, you learn to learn, and that's what future employers want to see in junior developers. The instructor of the course is Nizar, and he knows his shit. Not only does he know what he's doing, he's extremely passionate about it and truly cares about his students. On multiple occasions he would stay well past 9, to make sure he could help everyone and ensure everyone is on the same page. Nizar is not only a great teacher, but a great mentor.The T.A.'s, Ariel and Kevin, were also always eager to help, and would always be there for guidance. Building upon that, the entire staff at Ironhack is truly wonderful. They care about your well-being and almost immediately become your family.As mentioned earlier, the class is intense, it's definitely doable if you have the heart for it. My class size was about 20 students, but it was one of the larger cohorts. During the course, you truly become close with your fellow students as you're all going through the same experience. Brito, the job placement manager, is insane, and I mean that in the best way possible. In the last week, he will make sure you are absolutely prepared to get a job, whether it be making a resume, practicing interviews, and applying for jobs. He will do everything he can to make sure you get where you need to be, provided you put in the effort yourself. He's not there just to make sure you secure any job, just to boost some imaginary number. He will make sure that you get a job that is truly right for you.

The comradery that the students developed in the classroom was one of the most surprising parts of Ironhack for me. Week 0 you walk into a room full of strangers and by week 3 you feel like your amongst family. Unlike a traditional classroom in highschool or University, 100% of the students in the cohort take the course seriously and want to make the most out of their experience. That leads to a truly collaborative and learning focused environment the likes of which I had never experienced before. That classroom atmosphere really helped take the course to the next level. When you are learning from and teaching your peers, it really helps reinforce the concepts and skills you're acquiring.

He helped me tremendously in landing my first job and even now I continue to maintain a great relationship with him. He has a plug into the entire tech sector in Miami and is one of the most valuable resources at your disposal as an Ironhacker.

Actually taking it a step further, because Alia made sure I had contact information for any former students I wanted to speak with.When I was accepted to the program, I received personal phone calls from both Alia and Marisa. I mention this because it was in stark contrast from what the other schools sent: a form email that referred to coding bootcamp and a GitHub invite. The care and concern was followed through from day one. Weekly surveys and one-on-one talks that the staff holds with each student allow any issues (from speed of the class to mental wellbeing) to be addressed.

He used his network to give a couple of my UX endeavors a lot of attention which is above and beyond any job description he has.

He is very much involved throughout the entire course, whether its setting up amazing speakers to coming in, helping you write your resume, or teaching you everything there is to know about being a good job candidate. He used to be a SR IT recruiter and has even gone through a web dev bootcamp himself so he has a wealth of knowledge and most importantly- contacts for networking.Ariel Quinones (co-founder) - Really great guy, down to earth and is SO passionate about what he does. You'll see him around often and chat with him and he may even casually join you for lunch.Other shoutouts:Alia (general manager) is a joy to work with, she makes you feel like you can go to her for anything. You can tell she works her butt off to keep everything running smoothly and still always manages to have a smile on her face.Ariel (assistant instructor) is super bright and really great at explaining difficult concepts and breaking them down.My entire cohort- Awesome group to work with. Everyone was super friendly, non-judgmental, and always willing to work together and help each other out. I am so thankful that the people at Ironhack purposefully select people that they think can "play well with others". I made really great friends during my time there. Some other points I'd like to make:- the Ironhack team does a really good job at asking you throughout the course what you think can be improved. They are also very in-tune with how you're feeling about your performance whether or not you need extra help or accomodations.- The building where the course takes place is SUPER cool. There's a nice grassy rooftop to relax outside when you've been staring at a computer for hours. There's also a free keg and delicious snacks in the kitchen. Its also walking distance from the metro. Great spot.- **You do NOT have to be an expert in JS to take this course, but you MUST have a firm grasp on it. The course moves very very quickly and you can't be spending time re-hashing JS. The entire course basically builds upon JS so make sure you can code it comfortably.**- You're going to have to work on the weekends, otherwise you'll forget.- Try being a week ahead on assignments and doing them on your own. That way when it comes time to go over it in class you've already digested it at least once and you're prepared to ask meaningful questions.- The journey doesn't end after Ironhack, you'll have to work even harder to retain everything you've learned, apply it, and build on top of that knowledge. This bootcamp isn't a shortcut to a career, its a stepping stone.Bottom line? Great people, great course. If you're committed to this craft and you have a passion for it, go for it.Best of luck!Read Less",ironhack

Read More students before I started my bootcamp and they told me: “Say goodbye to your friends and family because you are not going to see them in two months” and also “The more you get involved, the more benefit you will get”. Well... after the bootcamp I can say that it was totally true and that it exceeded my expectations, mainly because I could not believe it would be so easy to find a job. It definitely was.It can be said that Ironhack is not just a matter of studying but also working hard and being involved in a "Learn by Doing Community". You work hard developing projects during the bootcamp, alone and with your mates. It is not studying theory but learning from the best professionals sharing their experience and from every mistake you do.The "Community issue" is one of my favourites: when you learn and work with other people, as you help each other, you see everyone gets to different solutions starting at the same point. You realise that the team grows ten times faster than you would learn online or in other courses. And also we got involved in the professional community: that helped us a lot to find jobs after the Bootcamp. Everybody says "College do not prepare people to work and you need to start in a job to really learn". Well, we had that first working experience really fast at Ironhack (that is the reason it is so tough) so I started working with more confidence about what I was able to do.Read Less",ironhack

I had always been a gamer, tinkerer, and someone that could generally figure out electronics, but I found myself working a job I didn't really... Read More like, for pay that I knew was below me (sorry kitchen workers, it's below everyone).I began my journey by attending a local Pittsburgh school (where I resided previously), studying software development. After taking a host of prerequisite courses, I finally had one online coding class scheduled in after a semester full of speech, philosophy, and biology. Much to my dismay, it was outdated; generally not that well put together; and taught me no valuable skills related to the field, which I can now objectively say as I'm in it.Fortunately, somewhere in that first semester of college, a family member told me about a radio show on NPR that mentioned coding bootcamps. As that second miserable semester and job-related stress began to grow, the idea seemed more and more like it should be a reality. I began looking into schools with none other than course report.At the time in Miami, Ironhack was brand new, although they were an established brand in Madrid &amp; Barcelona. There was another coding school in the area, but they lacked the international credentials and reviews from previous students that would allow me to feel comfortable in putting down a significant amount of money, move to another state, and restart my life. After the course, and being a part of the Miami tech scene, I can say that this was great intuition and am very happy with that decision.The PeopleIronhack from the start was unbelievably helpful. At the time, the team was very small, but I always had the opportunity to be in direct contact with the co-founder; Ariel.Ariel is an impressive co-founder and found a way to avoid the bad bits of Miami tech. At Ironhack, the people you will graduate with, be mentored by, and listen to as guest speakers are the top of the top. This is also reflected in the people he hires.Nizar, the head instructor, is a legend amongst Ironhackers and this isn't without warrant. He's an incredibly patient, talented teacher and developer. This is an incredibly rare combination. Often times in traditional schools (in my experience) you will encounter good coders who just don't have the ability to teach. This is why so many people think they can't code coming out of school. From interview to graduation, and beyond, Nizar is a rockstar.The Course The interview process was a bit nerve wracking, as most interviews are; but if you follow directions, put in the work to study, and really want to change your life you will succeed. You will be expected to learn a few coding topics relatively quickly, and then be tested on it.The course itself is more than likely unlike most academic experiences you've taken part in.Often times in school, you'll be introduced to facts and then be expected to memorize them. Once these facts are memorized, you'll spit them back out onto a quiz, and some person in the ivory tower gives you a piece of paper that says you're smart. This mentality is busted in development, and Ironhack's curriculum reflects that. You will be introduced to topics, given examples and the opportunity to ask questions, and then it's off to the races. You will build something. This is the X factor that online platforms such as codeacademy, treehouse, and others are missing. This is what propels you to be a quality developer. Building Things.There are no easy A's. You're judged on what you build. That is life as a developer.My AdviceIf you aren't happy with the way things are, change it. Do your due dilligence, sift through reviews, and call each bootcamp. I did this, I can say at this point based off of my skills and quality of life that I made the correct decision.Read Less",ironhack

While after university there is a huge gap between where you are and where you want to go, after Ironhack you actually have already contacts in where you want to go. In the bootcamp there will be events, people coming, lectures from interesting companies, but it will be up to you to network with them, nothing will come by itself. For example, after the hiring days 6 companies reached me and two weeks after I have offers for working for two of them. But it’s very up to you to have the initiative and search for the opportunities and also to decide which is a fair job deal. One month after I was hired in a big company with excellent wages and conditions, but still I feel it's rare. WHAT I LIKEDI went almost from zero in design. I had audiovisual background and it helped to improve some skills I  already had. But, I did build mostly everything from scratch. And now I feel like I increased 100% my skills. Immersive atmosphere it's all about design for 10 weeks. You will find yourself reading design articles while having breakfast and going to bed with design documentaries. "Team feeling". You spent a lot of time with the same persons every day. You better deal with it, make the most for getting along with them and encourage them to make things together. You will end the bootcamp with a groups of friends extremely motivate with design. WHAT I MISSEDGoing deeper in some parts of the curricula. More connection with lecturer's job during their classes. You are very free to do the tasks as good as you want. I missed more guidance when you feel demotivated in other to get better results for the portfolio. Not just getting task done because there are a deadlines.Read Less",ironhack

Others seemed to be far ahead of me because of prior coding experience. To be frank, I was intimidated, I wanted to quit and didn't think I could ever catch up. After the first few days, Ironhacks true strengths started to reveal itself. Nizar, my instructor, and Josh, the teaching assistant, were extremely helpful. To be clear, they helped me think through a lot of the problems or guided me to resources. I appreciate this a lot because it developed my critical thinking skills and also pushed me to become a better programmer. Josh and Nizar were able to do this because of the intimate class size, and I felt they were truly passionate in myself and other classmates.I also felt that the entire staff at Ironhack was unbelievable and open to having discussions with me. Ariel, one of the co-founders, was always at the campus and made it his goal to know all the students. He was always available to talk and address any concerns I had, or drink a few beers with me and the other students after a long week.At the end of the course Ironhack did a great job of prepping us for work. While I did not end up taking a developer job, Ironhack set me up for success in two ways. The first, Ironhack taught me how to learn. There was no answer in the back of the book, there were resources like stack overflow that I had to use to figure out my bugs. I had to be resourceful, and truly think through problems to see if they made sense, this was a skill that Ironhack helped develop. Secondly, while I did not take a coding job, Ironhacks location in a co-working space worked great for me. I was offered an unbelievable opportunity by a tech company that worked out the same space two weeks before the completion of the program. I would have not had that opportunity come to me otherwise.Ironhack was amazing, and an extremely worthwhile investment for me. While I don’t program now, I work with many developers who are helping build our product and it has made the conversations easier and the process 50x smoother. If you are interested in coding and are willing to do the work and challenge yourself, then sign up for a coding boot camp. If you really want to make a difference in your life, then sign up for Ironhack.PSI recently went to Ironhack site to check it out for old times’ sake and I saw they updated the course to more JavaScript and less ruby and they also added a UX/UI course.

Is it the right school for you? I was in your shoes and after graduation I can say 100% confident that going to Ironhack was one of the best decisions that I made in my life! The most important investment you can make is in yourself. Before IronHack I studied two years in University majoring in Computer Science and I dropped out. I was working regular jobs, but I always was interested in technology so I started learning how to code on my own. It's a great way to start but If you want make into a career It's much easier with a real mentor and help from professionals. Compared to my University IronHack teaching the latest trending technology like MEAN stack and that's exactly what employers are looking for. Learning process: your everyday routine will be starting with lectures and after more importantly - practice. You do some exercises in pairs and then individually. Lead instructor is Nizar - absolutely great teacher! He really knows what he is talking about and excellent with explaining, giving analogy examples to simplify things, and ready to help when you struggle. During lectures you can ask any question at any time. In class you will code along with instructor, there will be frequent stops where both Nizar and TA will make sure nobody is falling behind and everybody is on the same page. All staff is really friendly, cool and ready to help you. You can find yourself joking around with Ariel before you find out that he is actually co-founder. I liked project weeks the most, that's where you apply everything you learned and build your own application. You come up with an idea, design database structure and app architecture. I learned how to manage your project and your time (you have to meet deadline) along with public speaking skills (presenting your project). In reward: You will get portfolio with 3 projects that will easily separate you from University grads and show employers that you actually can build fully working apps.Your classmates will become your friends. You can find people with similar mindset and passion to create. Even having a full time job I am still working on side projects with people I met during IronHack. Also I moved in with two classmates, we extended our learning outside IronHack by helping each other after school and we became really great friends! Try to move in with somebody from your course, you will thank me later.What can I say about job searching? - Shortly, I had two job offers just in two weeks after graduation. They have a designated man that works full time to make sure you get hired - Daniel Brito (placement manager). He knows almost everybody in Miami tech ecosystem and will introduce you to those who are hiring. You are going to learn with him how to be a real job hunter and how to crush the interviews. He can give you some additional personal advises and will be helping you even after graduation.Sounds great right, but what's the catch? It's hard. If you are just looking for easy money that developers earn you are knocking at the wrong door. Course is intense and it's only begining, you will have to work hard to be successful. The most important skill that you need to learn is how to learn, how to be resourceful. On my job we use different tools than IronHack and you need to be ready for that. Be a coder means that you will have to learn all the time even after the course because there will be always new framework or new tool that just came out and you have to learn it. If you want to become a developer you have to love coding and be passionate about tech world.

Alia Poonawala, the director of admissions and one for the nicest people I've ever met, guided me through the admissions process and solidified my belief that I had made the right choice.Once class began I was introduced to the whole Iron Hack staff who are all incredible people! What I learned in class was everything I had dreamed about and more. We learned the whole UX/UI process and I finally felt like I had made the correct career choice. Our instructors Joel Mena and Jaclyn Levi, both professionals working in the UX/UI field, were extremely knowledgable and did a great job of teaching us the material. Having someone who works in the field as an instructor was fantastic as they both taught us and gave us invaluable advice about the UX/UI field.I would be remissed if I did not mention our TA, Eugy Alliegro. Iron Hack provides each cohort with at least one TA who is there to help guide us along the way and give feedback. Eugy was a TREMENDOUS help and was a key component to myself and all of my classmates learning the material and becoming UX/UI designers.For me, having a great time learning in an incredible environment (the Iron Hack workspace is BEAUTIFUL) was enough to be happy. Where Iron Hack went above and beyond was in helping me find a job once I graduated. Daniel Brito, the placement manager, is a rockstar! Daniel (or Brito as we call him) was in our ears about what we needed to do in order to gain traction in the tech community from day one. He is someone that deeply cares about the students and does everything in his power to place us once graduated. Brito's hard work and guidance helped me land a job right after I graduated from Iron Hack!Overall, I am extremely happy with the choice I made to change career paths and do so with the help of Iron Hack.

My aim was to gain skills that would allow me to bootstrap a project more easily. And I can honestly say that IronHack surpassed all my expectations.Ironhack is nothing like your University experience. It’s a super-intense, hands-on experience that merges learning, doing, building and networking. A typical day would start with lectures in the morning, exercises in the afternoon, followed by a seminar by Alvaro on personal branding, back to exercises in the evening and finally beers to power through the early night. The teachers are always available and willing to help, and the class soon turns into a group of very close friends. As for the learning experience, unbound by the constraints of traditional universities, IronHack can morph its curriculum on the go to keep up with the latest demands of the market, giving you the tools to keep on learning beyond and after the course.Overall my experience at IronHack was very positive. I think of it as the perfect complement to an undergraduate degree in any field, opening the door to a world of new possibilities. And most importantly, it was incredibly fun!After IronhackI wouldn’t say my life has been completely turned around, but I would retake the course a thousand times.

Read More a few months, even though I realized that I could teach myself a lot, I still had no idea about how to launch myself into a developer career.It feels really good to think that it was only a few months ago and that I'm now writing this review from my new job office.I'm French and I came in Spain only to do the bootcamp. It wasn't an easy decision to invest all that money and that time. That's why I take the time to write an honest review of my experience. Reading student reviews helped me to take my decision, and I feel grateful to the people who took the time to write one. Besides, I heard that Ironhack is now launching in Paris and I really want to be a part of the french Ironhackers community :)Basically, I started the bootcamp with little knowledge in HTML, CSS and Javascript. In only two months, Ironhack turned me into a Junior FullStack Developper.When I started my new job a few weeks ago, I was able to deliver something , and that felt good. Ironhack taught how to learn what I don't know and how to collaborate with a team. That means that from the beginning, the level will be really demanding (even the best student in my cohort would agree with that!). Days are usually 10-12 hours long.In my case, we had a new teacher every week to teach us a module. They all have a deep knowledge of what they teach and a real understanding of the professionals needs (since all of them work as developers). So every morning you'll a have class with the teacher, and every afternoon you'll put it in practice with an individual exercise and pair programming. That's probably the key of that bootcamp, a huge amount of practice. The teacher assistants, the most patient, dedicated, nice and skilled people you'll ever meet (really, where do they find them?) will help you to accomplish what will often seem impossible.You'll code real projects. In my bootcamp, everyone made a game after two weeks (and some of them were quite impressive). We also made two websites: the first was to sharpen our back-end skills and the last one was a complete application using Node &amp; Angular 2. In my case, I realized a project for a Madrid's Startup that is now a finalist in a local contest.At the end of the bootcamp, Ironhack team presented us to 20 companies from the local scene. Being able of showing real projects is certainly what made that many of us found a job then, and that Ironhack hiring rate is so high. In a broader scale, Ironhack's success comes certainly from its high sense of community (you'll quickly learn about the Ironbeers;). I mean that in my bootcamp I had a great time with the other students and we still party together. In that matter, Ironhack definitely has spanish DNA. But it's more than that. In my case, Ironhack organized events where I got to meet people from the most interesting Startups in Madrid.I have no doubt that Ironhack Paris will be as good (if not better) than in the other cities.

What makes Ironhack distinct from many other bootcamps is that they gear you for success right from the first interview. Placement into a cohort is dependant on passing a technical interview. It is very important that a potential student meets the technical criteria before attending the bootcamp because the material and course is not easy! After placement, there is a very hefty load of pre-work which I believe is just as important as the 8-week course itself. Completion of the pre-work is essential!

I saw the "learning to code" video with Mark Zuckerburg and all those other CEO's and I was inspired to learn... After a few weeks of CodeAcademy learning HTML &amp; CSS, I got... Read More curious and clicked on an ad mentioning a school in Miami that taught development over the course of 9 weeks.To everyone's surprise, it was actually Wyncode! I immediately clicked on the link, reviewed their site, tuition, and material. I even signed up for their "Learn to Code in A Day" event where they taught basic Ruby... At that event, I met a guy who was also at the course trying to build his site. I told him my interest in Wyncode and the developer role where he immediately told me that if I was going to pay for a school, it should be Ironhack. That was when I learned, that Ironhack is one of those schools that could have their doors packed with people &amp; students if they really wanted to. But they don't! They have a selective acceptance process where they try to weed out those that want to 'code' and those that have a passion for technology + code. It didn't occur to me at first but, that had been the single most luckiest and best decision I had ever made, choosing Ironhack. And I can say that, why? Because I experienced both. Not only did I go to the "Learn To Code In A Day" but my brother, who also wanted to develop, took the web-dev course, but at Wyncode. So here's my perspective on both, no strings attached. Ironhack's taught me how to be more comfortable with computers, code, and manage software and its architecture. It gave me a chance to really sit down with technology and learn the in's and outs, talk the talk but also walk the walk...Of course, every web-dev program will (hopefully) do that. The caveat is the people. The people here at Ironhack are phenomenal. From the lead instructor Nizar, to the wonderful ladies who tidy up the place when they need to; it was all wonderful. At first, my biggest fear was having this program be more oriented around business than the actual 'learning' part of everything. Kind of something like where you walk in, they teach you for 9 weeks and thats it, just a "good luck! goodbye!" That fear was immediately laid to rest when I met the team. If we are talking just culture, not even considering quality of the education, Ironhack has it down pat. These people truly care for you, and your future, as if your fate was their own. I have seen many of them go beyond their 'work' requirements to help a student in need; whether that be staying late to clear up some confusions for students or at times carpooling to a networking event. The Ironhack team is a team of focused, determined, and compassionate individuals who will get you to where you want to be, in your career. Now, lets talk about the education. Nizar is the lead instructor here, and was the main instructor in my course. The man is brilliant. Extremely patient with students, gives you room to fail and make your own mistakes when you need to but also catches you when you're going to fall too deep. The course itself is really well built, you pretty much have a couple hours of lecture everyday where they introduce you to the new material, followed by a pair-programming exercise and a do-alone exercise. We were also the first cohort where they introduced two other main projects to, whereas before you only had one final project that you had to present and demo for your graduation. This was one aspect that I feel Ironhack really excelled in. These first two projects really taught me a lot, not only about the actual code but also things like time management, soft skills and working with others, asking for help, etc that a lot of other courses didn't get to fully experience. Nizar does a phenomenal job taking care of his staff + students, and the quality of education really reflects that.Now, what about finding a job? They have a placement manager here, Brito, who's job is to connect you to companies who are looking to hire developers, and kind of get the ball rolling... Daniel Brito is one of Ironhack's greatest commodities, because he knows everyone in Miami and will go to extreme lengths to putting you in touch with the right person/company.This guy could sell water to a ski-boat if he wanted to. He pushes you to be just like him, a go-getter. He willl call you non-stop to make sure you sent the right email, he will chase you down to make sure you applied for the right company and he will give you the necessary butt whooping if needed. The guy has experience, has been in the tech business for some time, and is super well connected and has those relationships that are really necessary when looking for employment in the tech-industry. Plus, he's funny as hell. In the end, my brother needed to go back and re-learn a bunch of the material after his graduation. Till today, he calls me and asks for help and an extra pair of eyes for his code. And we took two different courses, almost simultaneously. All in all, Ironhack has a top of the line team with top of the line skills, and anyone who walks into the building can tell the second they walk in. It has changed my life and the way I look at it, completely. I will forever be in-debted to some of the people here that were so patient and took their time with me.

Prior to taking the course you should be able to solve problems using programming (javascript would be great but if you can do it in any other language it will be extremely helpful since you already understand the logic behind problem solving using code). Don't take this course just because you heard you can get a good paying job as a developer, take it if you like to learn about programming and you enjoy spending hours doing it. Also, be prepared for very long days, as they say, “it’s a marathon, not a sprint.”Read Less",ironhack

After researching and getting admitted... Read More to the Web Development bootcamp, I immediately felt as though I was kickstarting my life. A full emersion environment with like minded individuals who all want your best interest was more than anything I had been exposed to before. Having studied Systems Engineering for 5 years at GWU, I had never received the attention and passion that Ironhack provided me with. The instructors as well as the TA were extremely helpful and willing to go over any bit of information that I was confused on, stuck on, or wanted to learn more about. I never thought that in 8 weeks I would fully develop a new skill, and learn multiple new programming languages and be able to single handedly create a full functioning web application. This is something that made me a more desirable candidate in conjunction with my data analytics and system engineering background. The journey only begun there, however. The staff at Ironhack has somehow figured out a way to make each and every student feel as though they are the number one priority. Whether it was one-on-ones throughout the course to just check on your status and how you’re feeling, all the way to standing strong with me when I was ready to give up multiple times in finding the correct job for me. Daniel Brito specifically refused to let me give in to my doubts on finding the job culture fit for me. Although Ironhack was amazing with placing students in positions, I wanted THE position – the ultimate job, and I refused to settle on anything less than that. I have never met anyone who has more connections in a city than Brito, and it was almost humorous to me how almost every job I interviewed for, someone knew him and always in a positive light, which only made me have more faith. Ultimately when I began restructuring my job search, it was single handedly the fact that my resume was in the hands of the right people at the right places that I was able to get the opportunities that I did. And, I would not have had that advantage if I didn’t do Ironhack and have Daniel Brito as a career coach. Having finally started the next steps in my career at a well known fashion e-commerce company, I finally feel that I am in the environment right for me with the co-workers who can help me in growing with the company and excel in my role. And as it turns out, I got the interview since my boss had my resume on file from one of his best friends, Daniel Brito, and the with the right knowledge base and personality, I was able to secure the position.

Though a lot of the work and change has to come from oneself.The first instructor to get us going was Jacqueline and the best person for the job to introduce us to user research. She was a force of positivity and encouragement in the class. I really appreciated that. Joel another instructor had such a way of keeping one curious kept me always wanting more. Mr. Marcelo the instructor who came in after Jacqueline an amazing designer. All his vast amount of knowledge was golden. Josh our final instructor for the Front-end proportion of the course probably with highest difficulty part of the class but, still he helped us make it through, made it enjoyable, and fascinating overall. The classroom environment is really open and if one feels like they won't be able on the level with everyone else that shouldn't be a concern. All the students come from different backgrounds in a way that really adds to the experience overall and benefits all the students. The course is designed in a way to be accessible to all, but it is a large amount of information to squeeze into a small time frame. There were times throughout the course I felt one week feels like two weeks in one. It's partly due to the amount of information one absorbed in a small amount of time. One really has to be fully committed to doing this. Overall the people in the class helps one stay motivated and encourages everyone to really push oneself and keep going. The person to oversee everything in our class was Alida she made sure the class and everyone was on track all the way to career week.

Before starting classes, we had a week of pre-work to get started with the basics of design. My class was a small class (8 students) so we received very personalized attention. My classmates came from very different backgrounds and we all had different strengths which was nice. We had two amazing instructors (Jackie and Marcelo) that each have over 15+ of experience. During the bootcamp, we had lectures during the morning and hands on practice during the evenings, which in my opinion is a great way of learning. I think the curriculum was very thorough. And also it is nice that every other week you have a one-on-one meeting with the staff to make sure you are doing OK. Alida, the operations manager,was there with us to make sure everything ran smoothly. Wednesdays were my favorite day, because we had guest speakers who had years of experience in UX Design. Through the bootcamp, I was able to make great connections and to meet a lot of people involved in the tech and startup community. We had one week of front-end development (more specifically HTML5 and CSS3) which I wish we had more! Josh was an amazing instructor. We had a career week, which was a great experience. Daniel Brito did an amazing job bringing companies to interview for UX design positions and preparing us for these interviews.

Read More with learning how to code in the past through sites like Codeacademy and Udacity without much success, but working a full-time job meant I couldn't sign up for the course even if I wanted to. A month or so after telling myself it just wasn't meant to be, I received news that Ironhack was introducing a six month part-time course for the first time ever. I proceeded to look at the time commitment involved. Tuesday and Thursday nights and half of my Saturday for six months? I could totally swing that. Again, the money wasn’t an insignificant issue, but how many more times would I be telling myself “Maybe next time”? How much longer could I go about seeing the developers at work go about their ways and find myself regretting not having pursued this endeavor years ago? How would I feel seeing the students in the program presenting their projects six months from now and knowing I could have been a part of it?I submitted my application and was contacted by Alia, Ironhack Miami’s awesome Marketing &amp; Community Manager, to schedule an interview. We spoke that same day, where I told her my reasons for applying for the program and how it would help me grow as a professional and as a person. To potential applicants, think of it less as an interview and more as a conversation.After that, I scheduled my time for the second stage of the application process, the technical interview. Alia sent me an email with links to the material I would have to study, and when I wasn’t at work, I had my head down focusing on absorbing as much of the content as possible. When the day of the interview came, I would be lying if I said I wasn’t incredibly nervous about what task I would be assigned.Nizar quickly proved that all of my fears were for naught. He walked me through the steps required to complete the task and offered to help if at any time I became confused, frustrated, or just hopelessly lost. Luckily, it didn’t come to that due to the thoroughness of the study materials, but it says a lot about the quality of a program when its instructors understand how intimidating this part of the process can be. I won’t describe the nature of the practical interview for the sake of keeping it fair for future applicants, but trust me when I say that the Ironhack team will give you all the preparation you’ll need.I received my acceptance email the next morning and immediately paid my deposit so I knew it was real. A few days later, I received access to the platform I’d be using to complete the pre-work and some information on Day 0, the unofficial first day of the program.The pre-work was challenging but presented at a pace that helped facilitate learning of the early fundamental concepts. This allowed me to walk into the class the first day and follow along with the coursework we were presented with. The teaching sytle was incredibly hands on, a combination of lectures and practical exercise to solidify what we'd learned that day. The instructor and TAs were always available to answer any questions in a matter that further helped facilitate learning - instead of providing a direct answer, they would ask questions themselves and guide you to think of an appropriate solution. The learning platform was available 24/7 with all of the lectures and exercises covered in class to help get as much practice as necessary. The course did reach a level of difficulty that had me wondering at times whether I was meant to pursue this path, but the Ironhack staff consistently encouraged us to keep pushing forward one day at a time, all the way until it came time to work on our final project. That's where all of the topics we'd covered over the past few months accumulated into one concentrated effort - we were able to achieve things we'd never before imagined possible with code, bolstered by the support of the instructors, the mentors we were provided with, and each other. It was at this point that I also realized how strong of a bond I had made with my fellow classmates - we were always willing to help one another with any tricky issues that would come up and celebrated each other's success. The Hack Show served as a celebration of all the work we'd put in, where we each showed the collective product of our effort to a huge audience made up of friends, family, and members of the Miami tech community. I actually ended up winning the show with my project which was a huge surprise and sense of joy, but the overall purpose of the evening is to be proud of what we've done, not to chase a prize. The connections made throughout the program are nothing short of phenomenal. Daniel Brito is a veritable juggernaut at getting students to push themselves as hard as possible and matching them with phenomenal web development job opportunities. We were also connected to hundreds of other members of the tech community through various Slack channels we were invited to, only helping to further foster the sense of belonging. We entered the program as outsiders and left as essential parts of the Miami tech community as a whole. If you have any doubts at all about going through Ironhack, I'd strongly encourage you to experience it. It's a life-changing opportunity that some people could only dream of.Read Less",ironhack

I cant say enough about how well the curriculum was put together. I know it is very possible to learn coding and even UX Design on your own, but no amount of studying is going to introduce you to the network of of Developers and Designers that Ironhack has to me - and that I give a lot of credit to Daniel Brito, the Placements Manager at Ironhack.

There is a tremendous amount of information to absorb, perhaps too much, but the material is accessible even to complete non-techies like myself as long as students are willing to commit the time to study and work hard outside of class. Here in Miami our course was taught by two main lecturers who are both seasoned in their work and inspiring. In my opinion, studying alongside these experts in the field and being able to ask them questions as we progressed through the course material was what made Ironhack such a valuable experience. Jacqueline Stetson Pastore and Marcelo Paiva were wonderful teachers and continue to be mentors who are available to all members of our cohort.

Our UX/UI teaching assistant Alida Gagliuffi kept the group (and, when necessary, the teachers!) on track to ensure that we kept up with the demanding curriculum, and the Placements Manager Daniel Brito worked tirelessly to connect Ironhack students with employers in the community who had UX/UI needs.

I am thrilled to be embarking on a career in web product research and design and I feel well prepared to begin that work after studying with Jacqueline and Marcelo.

However, my situation was a little different as working at this company had been my dream.So, here I was on January 2016 looking for a “new dream”, one that could not be torn apart so easily and big enough to keep me motivated. I wanted to take this setback in my professional career and turn it into an opportunity to grow. I have always enjoyed solving problems as well as trying to understand how the technologies that have marked our lives nowadays work. It was at this moment that I realized that I could make an interesting mix with these two ingredients by learning how to code.I started looking online for possible ways to get into coding and that’s how I found out about Ironhack. I read excellent reviews about their programs, instructors, staff members and facilities, which motivated me to visit their campus in Miami. I was welcomed by Alia (Admissions), who kindly explained me everything about their coding school. At some point, after being amazed by her charisma, I even thought that Ironhack was too good to be true — Was it possible to learn how to code and launch a web application after only 8 weeks? Were their graduates really landing cool jobs with competitive salaries in the tech industry? I honestly was skeptic about it.That day I also met Ariel (Co-Founder), who shared with me his vision and explained how he, coming from a family of educators, wanted to change the world of education. It was something that I had never heard before.My visit continued with a tour around the facility and then I spent a few minutes talking to some of the students. It caught my attention that there were many students from different backgrounds and even different countries, including India! Why would someone from the other side of the world come to Ironhack to learn how to code? Maybe the reviews were true, maybe they knew what they were doing.And that’s when something inside me said that I should give this a try. I was already aware that as part of the admission process first I needed to do a general interview and then a technical interview. Of course, I spoke with Alia for more than an hour, enough to come to the conclusion that my personality was “ideal to handle the intensity of the bootcamp”. That only left me with the technical interview before I could be considered for a seat in the March 2016 cohort. We scheduled my technical interview with Nizar (Head Instructor) for the following week and then I left Ironhack with the feeling that I had done the right thing.Alia had sent me an e-mail with the material that was going to be covered during my technical interview. During that week, I spent at least 6 hours a day going over the JavaScript concepts and exercises. I must say that this was the first moment that I felt overwhelmed about programming. There were some concepts hard to understand and some exercises that I didn’t even know how to initially approach. And then the day of my technical interview finally came and I felt that I wasn’t ready. I was parked outside the school, debating if I should really do it or not — “What if I suck?”, “I don’t want to embarrass myself”, “Maybe I should just go home” — Unbelievable, what was I thinking and since when I was so weak? I was about to give up on this without even trying. No, no, no, I took a deep breath and walked in to finish what I had started.Nizar, who by the way is very fluent in English and Spanish, explained me the format of the technical interview: I had to solve a coding challenge with 5 iterations and I was allowed to use my notes, but there was a time cap (I don’t remember if it was 15 or 30 minutes). While I was working on the challenge, I realized that I knew more than what I thought. I was able to finish the first 4 iterations before I ran out of time. Yes, it was challenging, but it wasn’t that bad. Nizar reviewed my solution and gave me good feedback. I could felt right away that he had the vocation of teaching.A few days later, I got an e-mail from Ironhack, where they said that they had reviewed my application and decided to accept me for their next cohort. Wooohooo!!! That was a small victory after being so close of simply rejecting this opportunity. Once accepted, I paid the tuition, got access to their online student platform and was sent the pre-work material. The pre-work is a module composed of four parts that covers the basics of Ruby, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. As expected, in many occasions I found myself stuck with some of the exercises, but Ironhack was always available to do Google hangouts to go over my questions. This is when I met Josh (Teaching Assistant), who I knew was part of the first cohort in Miami and was now teaching others how to code. Josh, like Nizar, showed me his commitment as an educator.I finished the pre-work during Week 0 and then we kicked off the bootcamp with Week 1. I truly loved the layout of the program and most importantly I always felt that I was surrounded by great and smart people, always willing to help me and with such an incredible amount of patience, including my classmates. Learning how to code is not easy, but when you are in an environment like this one, it makes the process very enjoyable.By Week 2, we weren’t a group of strangers anymore, we were more like a family immersed in this new cool world. When we were not coding, we were talking about coding and in some cases listening even more about coding from other experts as every week Ironhack brought in speakers (senior developers, CTOs and CEOs) to give us insightful information about the tech scene in Miami.Our regular schedule was from 9 am to 6 pm, but I don’t remember spending less than 10 hours at Ironhack every day. I didn’t know I was going to love coding this much. At the beginning, I was skeptic about what Ironhack was capable of doing, and now I was experimenting it. In 8 weeks, I learned how to code and I also built my first web application, but most importantly, I learned how to learn. Being a developer means that you will never stop learning and Ironhack gave me the tools to keep doing this on my own.We concluded our cohort with a Hackshow, where everyone presented their web applications in front of 180+ people. This was a great way to celebrate our efforts and achievements, and a perfect opportunity to network as in a few days we were going to be in the job market as Jr. Developers.And when it comes to job market, Ironhack has another killer player: Daniel Brito (Placements Manager), who is not Romero Britto’s cousin but still does cool things. Daniel helped us with our resumes and online presence, he prepared us for our future interviews and introduced us to many employers. Some of my classmates got job offers right away, and some others, like me, took a little longer. Daniel always kept me accountable and motivated to never give up. His phone was available 24/7, I called him several times late at night and even weekends looking for feedback and he always picked up the phone. You can surely tell that he loves his job, which is helping others in their quest of success.I now have a job where I use technology to solve problems, where I’m constantly learning, and which has allowed me to improve my quality of life.Ironhack is not only a bootcamp, it’s a life-changing experience and a family that will always be there for you. It was through Ironhack that I discovered this passion and set a new dream for my professional career.I will never forget that deep breath I took before my technical interview.Read Less",ironhack

Seriously IronHack is just 8 weeks, and this is nothing, so it’s important to put in the hard work. The more you work the more you get it.To make a good final project is very important to solid your knowledge, make a plan for it, ask teacher for advise and think about it before starting, think, think and think.After bootcamp I came to London, I firmly recommended to go outside Spain, the good offers are here UK, Holland, Germany…. What I did to get a job, I download a list of all startup in London and I applied to them through emails to get interviews and test, didn’t stop until I got response. The same as the bootcamp 12h/ day sending emails, replying them, doing interviews…….Get a plan and follow it through, if your planning doesn’t work change it, but continue with confidence in yourself until you get it.My last point, companies know your level they don’t expect too much from you, what they want is motivation. show them your passion about programming and be very thankfull with them in every moment, that’s what worked for me and I think is the best approach.My best wishes IronHackersWork hard, Play hardRead Less",ironhack

I had my resume and LinkedIN redone to reflect the new skills I learned at Ironhack. It’s a process that lasts until you leave the course. At the end of the learning and coding portion, there’s a week of career building activities. Different companies will come in to interview you. I updated my resume and LinkedIN a few more times.	I feel really good about my skills and what I’m capable of coding. I’m also happy about all the friends I made in class and outside in the tech community.

This post will be somewhat long but it will be useful if you are trying to decide if coding bootcamps, and Ironhack specifically, would be a useful expenditure of your time and money.So, who are coding bootcamps are for: -	People with no programming experience who want a career that is both fun and rewarding-	People who have tried to learn coding/web-development on their own but got frustrated with how long it takes to learn-	Burgeoning entrepreneurs who want to learn just enough to make their business dreams a reality Who they are not for:-	Experienced programmers who thing OOP is child’s play-	Humans that don’t play well with other humansI fell into the category of those who tried (and failed) to learn this material on their own.

Read More as an entrepreneur with a small non-tech startup company which focus on customer experience and product development. When I like something, I’ll be the best ambassador of that product or service, but when I’m not happy, I’m always very honest about my reviews. This is part of my own personal opinion of my whole bootcamp experience. Something that I wish someone would have told me before joining the bootcamp.Before deciding to attend to IronHack, I have had several interviews for a few coding schools in the United States that were 12-weeks courses. Unfortunately, I didn’t get enough funds to attend to the one I really wanted. Then I found about IronHack in Barcelona that was a 8-week course and which the city’s living costs were also more affordable. Also all the reviews were almost 5 stars, so I decided to apply and prepare for the journey.I did a lot of online tutorials and practices few simple coding challenges because the previous schools that I applied to demanded to have basic programming knowledge. I was very surprised that the interview process was very easy, maybe is because the main focus of the school is to take students from 0% to 80%. I had the chance that a friend that attended another bootcamp had shared with me his experience of his pre-work of the other school. So I was kind of surprised how disorganized and how poorly made the pre-course work was. We were not even ask how we were doing with it at the time.I wrote my own very personal review, but since one of my classmates have better english writing skills and I couldn’t agree more on what the author wrote, which its content is similar the two pages I wrote, I asked for permission for posting and editing the review. I’ll just highlight a few other personal comments starting with to slashes ( // ) at the end of each paragraph of the author’s review.We were supposed to be sent a overall bootcamp feedback survey, but even before that they were already asking us for positive feedback. My classmate’s review post and my personal add-ons:“ … Still, there has yet to be any surveys sent out, yet each week we had to complete two surveys on the quality of our instructors. This speaks volumes to the quality and goals of Ironhack. Additionally, we were told that there would be extensive career help, even a spreadsheet for us to fill out in order for Ironhack to track our progress, yet, this request for a review was sent out before even a slight mention of such a spreadsheet. There’s been no career follow up, no LinkedIn or resume reviews and I am extremely disappointed, to say the least.// Before attending the bootcamp, IronHack sent me a PDF of more than 5 slides with “career support” that was supposed to taught during the whole duration of the bootcamp.I’m an entrepreneur, and one of the things that completly appreciated about this bootcamp is that it was meant for entrepreneurs, as their Twitter profile says, note that not a single lecture involved any entrepreneurial concept with code.My experience at Ironhack was amazing in regards to my peers and the quality of our TAs. Despite there being only one TA per 8 students, they went above and beyond to help us out and it was so appreciated. // Thanks to the TAs for all their effort!Aside from that, I entirely regret choosing Ironhack for my bootcamp experience as Ironhack has failed at their only two objectives: be a great educator and be a great business. My list of possible improvements is endless, but here are a few:  1 Start by actually vetting your instructors. Have them do a test run in front of you. Are they comfortable with public speaking? Do they engage the audience? Are they clear when speaking English? Are their materials written in proper English? Are the passionate about working with others? If you don’t know the answers to these questions, you shouldn’t be hiring the instructor. If you wouldn’t want to listen to them on a Monday morning, don’t hire them. Period. // There were days that I honestly think I’d learned more in CodeSchool, that the current lecture because some of the teachers didn’t seem to be prepared or didn’t have high teaching skills. 2 Be upfront about the condition of the work space and classroom. Ironhack should be ashamed of the condition of our classroom in Barcelona. I was ashamed when posting class pictures because the room looked so horrible and rundown, and it was. Paint chipping, the room hadn’t been swept or dusted in forever, there were maybe only three quality chairs in the entire room (how are developers supposed to code for over 10 hours a day on plastic chairs?), the room was unbearably hot and we had to pretty much protest for weeks in order to get fans which then just circulated all of the dust around the room. The projector didn’t even have a screen and it was close to impossible to follow along with the instructors having to adjust their settings so frequently. The tables were not actually tables, but rather pieces of lumber stacked on wooden posts even though the average Mac in the classroom was worth $1500. If one of those Macs were to fall and break, I think we can both say that Ironhack was not going to cover the costs.  // The first thing I’d learn while studying at industrial engineering: work conditions (weather, ergonomics, etc) affects productivity. I truly understand and appreciate that Barcelona is such a environmentally friendly city, but take into account that 80% of our bootcamp was not form Barcelona, and I’m from Panama City, Panama (Central America), where is 30ºC all year round, and I haven’t been that suffocated by heat in a workspace in my entire life. 6 tables, 2 fans, not enough! By day 2 there where two more, and that wasn’t even enough. I literally had to bring my personal fan until the last day of the bootcamp because I couldn’t focus on class or during my final project. Some electric extension were laying on the floor, where easily more than 10 times people have tripped because of them. Also, as programmers that were supposed to spend 10hrs+ a day in that room, I expected to at least have basics: water and coffee. Filtered water tanks or water dispensers with filters, specially when not even people from Barcelona drink their own tap water because it is awful!  3 Reevaluate which students are accepted into the program. While of course more students mean more money, if you don’t have enough TAs and are unwilling to provide more, then simply get more selective and accept fewer students. Also, students who have been working as a developer and beginners are not to be in the same class. Reevaluate your mission as a school and choose an audience. The majority of the time, it felt as if the instructors were speaking to 3 of the 16 students. // Either you take people from 0% to 80%, or from 20% to 120%. There where students that haven’t even finished the pre-work before coming to class, and were accepted to start anyway. A lot of them were so lost on the basic concepts. I think it may have downgraded the class for people with more experience.  4 Establish your worth as a school and stick to it. Although each student paid the same amount, certain students have been afforded the opportunity to retake the bootcamp. If that is the case, are the rest of the students going to get half of their money back? I didn’t think so. I, in no way, learned as much as I thought I would have and I know I would have been given more attention had I chosen one of the American bootcamps, yet a second round at Ironhack was never offered to me. Keep it fair, it’s as a simple as that. // The fact that there were several students that either dropped out or very lost in class and they just decided to skip some subjects and do what they could, should have never happened on the first place if the pre-work was better built and proper follow-up student/pre-work would have existed. 5 While MOB is clearly not the correct choice to host Ironhack, at the bare minimum, if it is known that there is going to be loudly obnoxious construction the FINAL DAY OF PRESENTATIONS, the day for which we prepare during the entire bootcamp, the day that Ironhack invites guests to listen to its student’s present, you find an alternative space in Barcelona to host the presentations. It’s not that hard, not to mention Ironhack’s connections to startups with amazing presentation spaces. I’m sure those startups would have loved the exposure and would have loved to be a part of the presentations. Get creative, don’t get lazy. // At the HackShow, there where 40-50 people in that room, and I felt ashamed that the audience had to uncomfortable watch our presentations which such heat. Also, as a finalist for the top projects, I was very sad that not a single video was taken by IronHack, like the previous cohorts, or even t-shirts with our handles where given to all the students, to have memories about our experience presenting our final project. This may not sound very important, but if you start adding features, even as almost meaningless like the previously mentioned, you shouldn’t downgrade by taking it away. *MOB: Makers Of Barcelona, where the bootcamp was being held.* 6 Know your audience. During our “hiring help days”, the first thing that Alvaro said was that most of us probably aren’t comfortable with networking and approaching strangers. False. The majority of my class came from backgrounds like communications, media, marketing, sports, recruiting, journalism, customer service, etc. Learn about your students before you attempt to advise them. Additionally, don’t have us go into a corner and show you our LinkedIn profiles while you tear them apart — it’s not thorough and it’s inefficient. Take the time to look at the profiles in advance, take some notes and then discuss with us. It will save both your time and the student’s. // I like people being realistic, but Alvaro saying that it was almost impossible to get a job in Spain as a non european, was absolutely demotivational. Nevertheless, one of my classmates and me, non europeans, got job offers, because we manage to find alternatives to pursue success. So, don’t just say it’s almost impossible without providing work arounds. Also, how come you claim to have a 97% rate of hired students when not even 50% of the students are showing up at interviews and with such non-existing follow-up after that? 7 Hire more TAs. Don’t be greedy. Money is great, but a stronger reputation is worth much more and ensures longevity. Having to sit and wait 40 minutes to ask a question is beneficial for no one, especially a newbie.// I get that some students may have slow pace while learning, but the other students that are paying the same amount of money, deserve the same kind of attention and assistance during class. If you don’t want to let anyone behind, make sure that each student is really prepared to start a coding bootcamp. 8 Lastly, hire someone that has both customer service and teaching experience to facilitate the education aspects of Ironhack. You need them. As a former educator, most of the things that went wrong were simply due to lack of planning and experience. Even our welcome meeting was lackluster and could have been full of creative and light-hearted icebreakers designed to get everyone introduced to one another. // TAs had enough work as being TAs, someone that takes care of the customer experience and product is very needed so we don’t end out writing this long reviews!!!I truly hope you view this feedback as constructive more than anything. Everyone wants to see Ironhack succeed, but without some adjustments it’s truly not worth it. “// Couldn’t agree more with this!

You will learn not only all the best practices and all the technologies required and used by the leading companies, but also you will be involved in a great and different experience where teachers and classmates work and practice together to get the best from every hour.Teachers are all excellent professionals with a huge working experience so learn from them has been a pleasure and a great opportunity.All eight weeks of the Bootcamp have been very intense but the hardest week for me was the second one, when I discover how to do TDD and it was very challenging.

Before Ironhack, I was in business, doing completely unrelated to programming. I even had a great fear for anything technology. One day I decided to cast off my fear of tech and started learning how to code. Though I was studying dilligently, it was very inefficient. As a responsible adult with responsibilities to fulfill, I thought going to school and learn "how to learn coding" in a short amount of time seemed efficient than reading posts after posts on stackoverflow. And, I am glad to tell you that I made the right decision. What makes Ironhack very unique was people - my classmates, the teachers and the staff. My classmates were from all walks of life and open-minded, which made me feel ok to ask even seemingly silly questions in the class. I still hang out with some of my classmates even after the program ended. The teachers were great, too. Though some classes and the curriculum have rooms for improvement such as installing some programs prior to the cohort begins, the lead teacher, with knowlege, passion for coding and teaching, patience and care for each one of us, made my learning experience the excelent one. The staff. I decided to attend Ironhack because of the staff. Everyone was always thinking about how to create an open and comfortable environment and make the learning experience fun. They provided us many opportunites like happy hour, beach BBQ, and pinada smashing (to release our stress) for us to socialize and have some break. They also set up a weekly meeting where students can provide feedback and share their thoughts. People there were "real."Lastly, Ironhack provided great job assistance. Of course, I had to do 99% of the work following their strategic advice, but they set up interviews with companies (I received a job offer from one of them), provided useful resources and followed up with me on the phone almost weekly for practical advice and encouragement. As a result, I received a few job offers and am currently working for a growing tech company (where my colleagues know the Ironhack lead instructor).Ironhack really changed my life. There are many schools out there with different emphasis but I think the value of going to a coding school is to build skills, confidence and knowledge to continuously learn new technologies. Like myself, many coding school students will probably end up learning something new or maybe unrelated to what they have learned at school. Then, my recommendation is to go to a place like Ironhack where you interact with good people in a good environment where your learning experience will be joyful.Read Less",ironhack

My experience wasn’t all butterflies and rainbows. It was probably one of the toughest experiences of my life. There is a ton of content and it is constantly changing. It is a very rigorous curriculum with an aggressive timeline designed to really challenge you. It put my ego to the test, it made me feel dumb at times, and frustrated in others. The first week and a half I felt like I had been knocked down, but this was done intentionally, which I appreciated after the fact. It got me into gear and forced me to adopt a “can do” attitude. From a personal development standpoint the program helped me learn how to better overcome difficult situations, how to ask for help, and to really understand how detrimental negative self-talk can be to ones progress. From a technical development standpoint I was amazed at how much I learned and how much I was able to accomplish. I think what really differentiates Ironhack from other schools is their amazing team and their culture of “ the customer is always right”. I really loved and was really impressed by the constant feedback loop they incorporated into their system. It felt like a very intimate experience because they cared about my concerns, my thoughts, and most importantly my progress.

I enjoyed living there immensely, was able to meet a lot of locals, and lots of great people in general. It's also relatively inexpensive and very walkable.Staff: People are really friendly, and... Read More I want them to succeedInstructors: About half of our instructors were great to fantastic and we learned a ton during their weeks.Class size: We had just 10 people in my cohort and we really felt like a family by the end.Atmosphere: It's very laid back, and a comfortable and safe feeling space.Network: They have a good Barcelona network, which is great if you want to live there and have an EU visa.Job assistance for EU citizens: They have a strong network in Barcelona and can get you interviews. Instructors and speakers will also be looking out for you and helping make connections. However, once my colleagues who are EU-citizens left Barcelona they found that assistance dropped off like a cliff and there was minimal communication. I learned a ton.Cons:Staff: Despite their friendliness, communication was a huge issue. Even before class started, I missed most of the Hangouts because I didn't realize the times were being posted to Slack. Emails were not returned in a timely manner before, during, and after my session. People were defensive when offered feedback. I was often told "So and so will contact you about your concern." and then silence.Instructors: Two of our instructors were awful and it felt like they just wasted a week of our time which is a big deal when you are only studying for 6 weeks. We basically had to relearn everything we learned from our first JS teacher. They made up for the bad CSS class by bringing in a great instructor later on, but it meant we lost a day of working on our final project. Curriculum: It was frequently commented by my colleagues that it felt like we were being experimented on too much and I agree with them. We alternated between JS and Ruby instruction and the context switching was very confusing. They started us off the bat with Ruby and OO which was completely overwhelming for most people our first week. Visa sponsorship for non-EU: You will probably not be able to find someone to sponsor you for a visa. I wanted to stay and it seemed like it should be doable (I was one of the strongest students in the cohort), but even though there was some interest ultimately what I heard was it's way too hard to sponsor and very few companies are willing to do it. You are limited to large foreign companies and even then it can take 3 months.Job Assistance: Good or bad depending on your needs. I'm going to move this out of the bullet, so read on below.We lost internet for a few days and last a ton of class time as a result. They didn't have a contingency plan so we had already lost almost two days before they found us a temp new space. Internet was pretty consistently bad the whole time we were there.Job Assistance:They were great while I was still in Barcelona, but as soon as I returned back to the states they went silent. I had previously decided with the cofounder that we would work on Barcelona until I left and then switch to SF. After two weeks of silence (I pinged a couple people during that time), I sent another email and this time they apologized and said it was a new guy's responsibility.I scheduled a Skype call with the new guy and I thought maybe things would improve. Well, he sent me a list of sites with job postings. And then the next week he sent me another email with one more site with a job posting. In the meantime I was adding the jobs I applied to on to a spreadsheet so they could see my progress.I did know that they would have less of a network in the states, but the cofounders are well connected. So I knew that it would take more effort on my part. However, job placement is absolutely crucial for any startup bootcamp, and Ironhack is expanding in to Miami. To succeed in the more competitive bootcamp market in the US, you need to cultivate relationships with companies that are specifically interested and willing to hire bootcamp students.My expectation was that they would reach out to companies and pitch Ironhack and their students– in other words be proactive. What actually happened was they checked my spreadsheet and if they knew someone there they put me in contact. Which is helpful and I don't want to discount that, except 2/3 of those contacts were for companies were I had already gotten myself an employee referral and since their contact wasn't in a position to hire me they couldn't really provide me any assistance. In my opinion this just isn't aggressive enough because if they can't hit a high placement % then they are doing good enough.Ironhack's response is that they are working hard and this is what they told me I'd get, so if this meets your expectations you wil be fine. If not job placement is really important to you, you may want to look elsewhere.Tl;dr: Can be good depending on your needs. They can help you get jobs in Barcelona if you are eligible to work there, but if you want a lot of help for a non-EU job search they are limited to providing contacts to companies you've applied to. So far from my cohort the only person placed through Ironhack was hired by Ironhack.Summary:It was a fun experience overall, and I don't regret it. I did learn a lot despite the hiccups. However, I can't help but feel like they could have done much better and the communication was consistently a huge issue. I felt frustrated by the time wasted because of bad or unprepared instructors and bad internet. I felt like they missed a lot of important topics such as code reviewing and interview prep. And job assistance didn't meet my expectations at all. So yeah, YMMV. Living in Barcelona though, that I can recommend with no hesitation.Read Less",ironhack

And we learned specific technologies like Ruby on Rails, SQL, HTML/CSS, Javascript, React/Redux, Node &amp; the MERN stack. We practiced using git &amp; github extensively. We learned Test Driven Development thru technologies like Rspec &amp; Capybara. Most importantly, we learned to learn. For example, when it came to the MERN stack &amp; MERN projects, the instructors stopped holding our hands and made us practice picking up a new technology ourselves. My cohort was supposed to be an in-person cohort, but it turned out to be online only due to Covid. At first I was upset that I wouldn't be able to interact with my instructors and classmates on a daily basis, but it turned out to be a blessing in disguise - with the amount of work we had to do every day, I couldn't imagine having to spend another hour or two each day commuting.I would give a 5-star review, but I do think it can be improved in a few ways.1) A large part of the curriculum focuses on Ruby and Ruby on Rails. I believe that this is part of the design, in a sense, because Ruby is an easy introduction into the world of programming. We had people that came from completely different backgrounds and had little prior programming experience. However, it's looking like Python &amp; Django are becoming more popular now and I wish we had some exposure to these frameworks as well. It appears that future aA cohorts will, in-fact, be going this route instead of RoR.2) While aA has a wealth of knowledge on App Academy Open - the main tool for content for our curriculum (it's where all of our projects, homework, and readings were housed), that portal is not very organized. If I wanted to go back and reference something we learned 4-5 weeks back - it was hard to find. I wish they made all the projects &amp; topics we covered searchable.To say that App Academy was intense is not an understatement. About 1/3 of our initial cohort didn't make it to the end.

Benefits:* The latter half of the program teaches the frameworks mentioned above alongside building projects with those frameworks to populate a portfolio on your resume. I was delighted to find that they tackle every aspect of the job search process, since I had effectively no portfolio before a/A.* Schedule includes weeks to focus entirely on projects and gain skills working on a team, as well as 'half-and-half' weeks to do solo projects and resume crafting, and of course many more weeks spent on new concepts.* Schedule is very flexible, and instruction team is fair. Assessments may be curved or re-evaluated based on the cohort. * Every member of app academy (that I interacted with) takes responsibility if something is wrong or needs clarification, fixing, or more time. I don't remember anyone being unapproachable. Criticisms:* When students get deferred to another cohort, they simply disappear. I understand it may be embarrassing to defer (although it shouldn't be - life happens, you need more time, it didn't click), but just silently removing them might not be the best solution. I felt the cohort steadily shrinking as people left, and became increasingly stressed that it would happen to me, since we were the first cohort of the year and the students ahead of us had different curriculum and couldn't join us. Most other cohorts will not be in this situation, though, as they will have new students join.* The 24 week pace isn't as consistent as I'd like. The first 4 weeks are essentially just making sure you passed the free online intro to programming course that they offer, or getting you up to speed if you didn't. It very quickly ramps up, and some weeks have very difficult assessments while other weeks see a class average of 100%. I understand some material is very hard to assess, though - such as learning a new framework or database, where it is more trivia than anything else. Final jurisdiction:I had graduated from uni without much of a portfolio, and without the ability to pass coding interviews despite my degree.

With that said, there are several factors that I'd like to stress for others who may be making similar considerations:PROS:- This program will, at the end of the day, accomplish its goal of teaching you how to code. Or at the very least, will help equip you to continue learning more on your own after the bootcamp is over - It's recognized as one of the top bootcamps, which is significant since bootcamps can have a stigma associated with them in the actual workplace- The TAs seem to genuinely want everyone to succeed, and the fact that they are all former students makes them more empathetic to the pressure on current studentsCONS:- Curriculum or general operating procedures don't seem as polished as they could be. Several of the recorded video lectures towards the middle of the curriculum seem more dated, which didn't instill the highest sense of confidence in the product that App Academy provides- Intense focus on passing assessments. As other reviews mention, the foundation of the curriculum is based on weekly (and towards the end, bi-weekly) assessments. Failing any of the fundamentals assessments (weeks 1 and 2) results in being deferred to another cohort, and failing any 2 of the 6 remaining assessments results in dismissal. While this certainly keeps students on their toes, it also results in prioritizing just passing the assessment over understanding the concepts, especially if you don't have any prior CS knowledge- Pair-programming for hours every day, especially over Zoom, is taxing. Pair programming is clearly a huge part of the App Academy experience, but as one of the first cohorts that was taught the in-person curriculum entirely over Zoom, it would have been preferable to see App Academy try to be more creative in addressing specific needs of an online experience All in all, if you're looking for a way to accelerate your journey into becoming a software engineer, feel that you have a good support system, and are ready to work really hard, a bootcamp might be the right choice for you.Read Less",app-academy

I reveal all this info about myself because there are tons of reviews that talk about the curriculum, specifics of the frameworks they use, etc. I wanted my review to speak to someone who might be reading this and see themselves in my description of myself— not sure they can fit in in the coding/techie world, or handle a high intensity bootcamp. I won’t sugarcoat what a challenge a/A was, but I am SO, SO grateful I stuck with it, and definitely recommend App Academy, its instructors, and its community vibe that was so welcoming to this anxious new programmer! App academy’s material is really well structured too, so I feel like I’m in a good position to keep learning and improving my skills along multiple axes with all the material being a student gives you access to forever.

The general structure of regular assessments with severe consequences (can lead to being kicked out of the course) adds a significant amount of stress for students. While I understand the reasoning for this from App Academy's perspective, and believe that it is an overall positive, it can lead to a sense at points that instructors are "teaching to the test". While the pace of the bootcamp is very rapid, the structure of the course materials and projects means that you'll end up working over the same concepts multiple times after their initial introduction, the end result of which is that App Academy will teach you a huge amount of skills in a relatively short period of time. My cohort at App Academy was originally intended to be in person, but ended up being entirely remote due to COVID-19. I don't believe this had a large impact on the skills I've learned in the course, and the instructional team did a great job of adapting to a life on Zoom for the duration of the course.

In the readings, there are numerous typos, grammatical errors, misleading statements that confuse the amateur, and also inaccurate coding instructions in projects that derail students and waste a lot of precious time. There are usually better outside sources that teach the same topic better. It is not exactly the same curriculum as their successful in-person curriculum model at SF and NY. Throughout the 6 months of the online full-time course, they were slow to revise, update, change, correct video, reading, exercises material and resources.- Not all of their instructors and career coaches are competent for the job (at least for the online program I attended). Some lack in expertise of subject-matter. Those that are proficient in subject matter are either deficient in teaching skills or completely do not know how to teach effectively (this is coming from a former teacher at all levels and a world-class curriculum developer). Their hiring team is questionable since they are behind hiring their TAs, instructors and coaches for the reasons just stated.- They do not offer an official piece of paper (if that matters to anyone) such as a diploma, certificate as-of-to-date. I'm also not sure about academic credits, you should ask them. They might incorporate this in the future.- You will not at all be ready when you graduate (if you are coming from a non-CS and non-tech background). You have to put in the smart and hard work and discipline yourself after graduation for a few more months to reach a level of adequacy as a Web Developer/Coder (let alone a Software Engineer). Going through the program will not do that for you (again if you are coming from a non-CS and non-tech background). I feel like this definitely could be remedied with better curriculum development (emphasis on depth of knowledge rather than breadth like replacing the time and effort to learn some extraneous techs with more emphasis on constructing more projects and polishing them up and learning one tech stack really well since the rest can be self-taught) and to get a better hiring team to get real teachers in there, but alas! My valuable counsel has been ignored as far as I'm concerned.- You will have to pay them back even if you don't land a coding/web development/software engineering job with the conditions above.- The language in their legal contract before you are accepted is extremely skewed in their favor and oppressive, so if enough students voice their concerns and demand slight changes this will be better in terms of fairness.Read Less",app-academy

Read More (One eg: for about a month my instructor (someone who'd graduated from a/A 1 year prior, with no other software dev experience) actively wrote the day by day curriculum that we were actually taking.) Having attended the online curriculum, I can only speak to that: there were few to no attempts made by staff in order to foster a sense of community among the cohort, even as they spoke of such measures being undertaken (in an official capacity) in the in-person cohorts.These faults (among others) might be admissible if the curriculum was very strong. The fact of the matter is that the written material for the Ruby course (still as of this writing freely available through a/A Online) is an amazingly written curriculum. The JavaScript portions (over half of the material), however, were a far cry from this standard. It was evident the material had not been updated, in some cases, for years. One of the things I truly disliked about going through a/A was that there were several times where I asked my instructor for help with a problem given in the curriculum, and they were unwilling (in one case) or unable (in another two cases) to help me. Now, I can't really fault someone who is out of school for a year, and who doesn't have any real life experience whatsoever to not know the intricacies of what I was asking (which at least in one case went above and beyond the curriculum), but I found it egregious that there was no system of escalation in place. Was there really no technical instructor in a/A's roster that could take some minutes to walk through an implementation of Knuth's Algorithm X?These are only a couple of the gripes that I had with the system. They had feedback tools available, which I used in order to tell them about all of these incidents in turn, as they happened. I never once saw resolution, and no one ever reached back out to me about my issues. It seems to me that this shows a/A is simply very disorganized at a very high level, in need of some serious reshuffling of priorities.As I write, my cohort is graduating in 2 days and we are starting the job search portion of the program. I have hopes for this portion still, because I figure that getting me a job is really a/A's core business, far and away from teaching me to code.

I'm reviewing anonymously and only writing this one review because I don't need the free T-Shirt(a/A does NOT require you to write a good... Read More review) but there's a couple things I'd like people to know before choosing a/A.Pros: The curriculum is good because you learn a lot in a very short amount of time which proves to yourself that you're an adaptable problem solver which I think is the most important part of getting into this industry. The instructors are amazing(shoutout to Soon-Mi, Bryce Morgan, John-Michael Riley, you guys are the best), and I met a lot of really awesome people at a/A. Cons: Lectures could definitely be more interactive, a few people surprisingly got through admissions and weighed down classmates hard(If you actually did the prep-work before applying, don't worry, this probably won't be you), and new material towards the end was rushed. Is it possible to learn all of this on your own? Most definitely, but you have to be out of this world dedicated to learn it in a similar amount of time.Clearing up a Misconception: Not everyone will need to put 80+ hours a week, in fact, I might even say if you're the type of person that will go all-in for a short period of time, say just a few weeks, then completely burn out, this is not the proper strategy to getting the most out of a/A. I used to be one of those people, but I learned to have dedicated time away from work. I would either finish the homework as soon as class ended or finish it just before going to bed, and the rest of my time was spent with friends, family, or alone doing anything other than looking at programming. By doing this I was able to be fully rested everyday and managed to not only get through the material avoiding burnout, but retain most of the information. This approach may not be for everyone, but this was my experience so I think it's worth considering when imagining your time at a/A.Context: I'm definitely an outlier when it came to attending a/A, I started teaching myself programming since middle school and started a/A just a few days after turning 18. My prior experience barely helped me absorb the material better, and so long as you complete the prep-work, you'll be on track. I never went to college, didn't do amazing in highschool, and for those wondering, I did get a job as a SWE.Also, I can do all of the assessments in under 20 minutes so if anyone beats my times, congrats you deserve a cookie.Read Less",app-academy

Read More the deferred plan over the upfront plan————————————————————————————————I came to App Academy with zero experience in programming. When I was in college, I always felt a pull toward taking computer science classes, but had managed to convince myself that it wasn't for me - after all, I have always been a humanities/arts person and, even if I made the switch at the time, there were so many younger, brighter people who had been at this for years whom I would always be trailing behind in this industry. I found myself with some free time between projects at a moment when I was looking for a little more intellectual challenge in my daily life. I came across a/A and figured it would be worth a shot. I had the time, they had an online curriculum, and, in the worst case scenario, I’d have a new skillset without needing to pay for any of the training. Fast forward 6 months of class time and 1.5 months of job searching and I am happy to say I am now working full time in the tech industry! I appreciated the difficulty that a good portion of the admissions process posed. I felt other bootcamps I was considering were too lenient in handing out acceptances, which made me very skeptical about their genuine interest in teaching me over adding my money to their pile. I was glad I had to work for my spot, and I felt confident that the students I would be moving through this with would be equally motivated by the challenge.One caveat is that their current admissions process does seem to have lightened up a bit - from what I understand, the online applicants no longer need to take a technical exam - I would push for applicants to investigate why this change happened and what steps a/A has taken to ensure they remain as selective as they’ve always been.I would say an important thing to keep in mind is a/A does not train you to be a master programmer so much as it trains you to be an adaptable one. I can say that the sheer volume of new material we covered in class has given me the confidence to tackle new challenges in my current job. I’ve been lost before and have found a way out every time, and I have no doubt this will continue to be the case as the workload gets harder. You can expect to spend as much time as they advertise per week (60-80 online, 80-100 in person), though this may vary quite a bit depending on your particular situation. I struggled to adapt to the methodical approach to problem solving in tech, so I found myself often spending around 90 hours a week. Additionally, the market is and always will be unpredictable. An important thing to keep in mind is that the jobs search will be different for everybody. I would emphasize that luck played a big role in my being able to land a job relatively quickly. Regardless, the support system in place was critical for me. A huge plus to this program was the care I received from my career coach. While I can’t speak for how other coaches may have been, my coach in particular, Mark Rodriguez, was always willing to lend a helping hand whenever I ran into trouble, whether that was technical or emotional (job search can be quite a journey….).Beyond this, I want to give a shout out to my TAs, Bryce Morgan and JM Riley, and my instructor Soon-Mi, all of whom were incredibly brilliant at breaking down technical concepts into a language that this art major could absorb. As far as cons go, there were still some areas of the curriculum that I felt could use more work. a/A is adaptable to market needs, which means the curriculum is often changed to match what employers are looking for. The downside to this is some of the newer portions of the course can be rushed through (particularly the GraphQL and Docker portions of my cohort). The pair programming was also a mixed bag for me. My particular cohort involved pair programming every single day, and while I was very clearly able to see how much my ability to communicate technical concepts improved because of this, I do feel it sometimes came at the expense of actually learning the material. I never wanted to be the partner slowing the other down, so I often found myself going with the flow rather than really trying to dig into something that confused me. To be fair, my instructors made it a huge point to tell us to avoid exactly this. Additionally, the lectures were not as hands on as I would have liked. We had video lectures which were very thorough, but they sometimes spanned several hours with little time to actually test out the concepts before diving into the larger and more intimidating pair programming project for the day. I would recommend a/A put some time into divvying up it’s lectures to allow students to briefly put the theory to practice and enhance absorption. This would do wonders for the attention span, as well. Finally, cost. App Academy is not a cheap program by any means, particularly if you intend on opting for the deferred plan over the upfront plan. This is not taking into account any additional expenses you might have as well (health, rent, childcare, credit card debt, etc.). For that reason alone, I always urge people to grill their admissions team to ensure they know exactly what they are getting themselves into. Make sure your goals align with what a/A may be able to provide you. This is very much a long term commitment, stretching further than just the duration of your course. To a/A’s credit, I will say that the finance team has been wonderful to work with so far. I started my job as COVID-19 was ramping up, and they’ve been more than willing to postpone my repayment schedule in order to ensure I’m financially sound. Overall, I’m very happy with the outcome of having attended a/A. I finally got around to learning a skill I had spent so long dooming to the corner of maybe-one-days, and managed to get a job out of it. It’s tough and it can sometimes be messy, but I would say the experience was worth it.Read Less",app-academy

I'd always been interested in tech, but could a bootcamp really take me from nothing to software developer in 6 months?... Read More The answer is... Yes! BUT you have to be ready to put in a tremendous amount of passion, dedication, time, and effort. There's no magic secret to App Academy... It's just a lot of hard work. No one can learn to code for you, and no one can get a job for you... That's all on you! But App Academy provides you with all the tools and support you need, and it was a truly life changing experience for me. The core curriculum (as it was when I attended) is incredible - I can't praise it enough. You don't just learn web development frameworks, you learn how they work under the hood. The TA's are always willing to help you when you run into issues, no matter how long it takes. And your fellow cohort mates will be fun to work with! A lot of students (including myself) were dubious of pair programming in the beginning... And although it's not perfect, the pros far outweigh the cons. Communicating your code to others is a make-or-break skill in the job search, and pair programming is a great way to develop that skill. Some days of pairing will be better than others, but that's just life haha. If you're worried about the workload, don't be. Well ok... maybe worry a little haha. App Academy will keep you busy all day, every day for the entirety of the program, weekends included. This is especially true if you're striving for a deep understanding of the material (which you should be!). But learning software development is a fun and rewarding process, and although the workload was immense, I found it enjoyable. There will be times when you feel overwhelmed, but there's a strangely satisfying feeling that comes from being thrashed day after day after day haha. I think the most difficult part is the end of the course when you're building your own projects. I'm a perfectionist, so I put a lot of pressure on myself, and worked very long hours. I had no school or prior experience, so I knew my portfolio would be a critical part in showing off my abilities as a developer. Once projects are completed, you will move into the job search, which is a completely different challenge. You have to balance sending out plenty of applications, preparing for interviews and continuing to learn and grow as a developer. You will be responsible for structuring your days and holding yourself accountable, and it's really easy to get lazy and unmotivated (I know I did), especially when your pipeline is empty. Also, don't expect your career coach to get you a job - there's only so much they can do. To give some detailed job search stats, I sent out a total of 333 applications, which resulted in 8 phone screens, 3 coding challenges, 2 on-sites, and 1 job. I was extremely fortunate.All in all, App Academy was an amazing experience. However, it seems like App Academy is growing and changing, as all companies do. I can't say for certain if the experience of future cohorts will be the same as mine. I know the curriculum has been completely overhauled, and I'm not sure I would call it an improvement, based on what I've seen. It'll be up to you to decide if App Academy is the right choice, but I'm happy to say that it worked out very well for me, as well as many students before me.

The pair programming definitely helps pass the time (depending on the partner).

The instructors were genuine in their desire to help us learn and succeed.

Honestly, I feel like the note taking took longer but I absorbed the content better. Although it is nice to have a digital searchable archive of my notes. Try to absorb the material but not necessarily memorize it. Doing the homework will help you be ready to pair program which will keep you on track. Oh and don't forget to fill out your evening reports. We were were not told this until towards the end, but those reports ("what I learned", "challenges", etc) can be useful during your job search. Because of this, it may be useful to take notes as you work for these reports (you will likely be tired by the time reports are available to be filled out).(curriculum) Honestly, most of it is really good stuff.

There are a ton of projects but it seemed like the goal was exposure not necessarily building a portofilio (until the last weeks). You have assistance when you need it and hopefully a fun partner each day that you work with. There were a few projects/assignments that I really enjoyed and some that I really didn't. Some projects are very applicable to the real world, (building websites, designing, constructing games/apps) while others are very scholastic(working on algorithms/math type problems, and writing "lite" versions of complicated stuff so you have a better understanding or appreciation). I honestly feel like some of the scholastic projects could be removed and the course would be enhanced. The two months are working solo as well as in a team to develop multiple web applications from scratch (from a pre-approved list). You will also make a portfolio and prepare for the job search (with readings and homework).

For the most part, I see it as generous. You really can't be kicked out if you are doing what you are supposed to. The Job Search: After you complete your projects and your official last day the hard work isn't over.You are given a career coach who work with you to get you ready for the job search. He or she will require multiple things to be met each week. You must get a certain number of points per week and a certain number of application or you are given a strike. Personal tips:Don't over commit yourself.My marathon:I had already committed a couple months of training prior to signing up for a/A. This would be my second marathon and 10th or so long run event. I was on track for a 3:30 marathon PB but the marathon was not until 4 months later. Rather than paying to downgrade my marathon to a half or 10k ($100 bucks to do so), i just opted to continue with it. My training regiment had me doing a small amount of miles at the start of the course so the first month felt like a breeze. However, the next 21 weeks were living and breathing code and more strenuous running workouts. My schedule consisted of waking up early in the morning (after late evenings of homework) and training for my marathon for about an hour with long runs on weekends. Aside from that, I quickly began battling over tightness of my quads that never let up (and eventually led to injury). I got to 3 months into the course before I started experiencing Achilles issues. By the time the marathon came around I was not in good shape. Mentally exhausted from the course work and assessments and dealing with the Achilles issues, as well as unforeseen family medical emergency. There were days when I couldn't even run a mile before my Achilles just forced me to walk. Luckily, I abandoned my PB goal and was now just focused on not injuring myself but foolishly kept pushing. I ended up completing the marathon in 5 hours and 20 mins. Was it worth it....maybe? lol It felt like a bigger accomplishment than my first marathon but of course but the damage had been done. I am still struggling with Achilles injury (3 months after marathon) and fell behind during the most difficult, and honestly what I felt like, the most important portion of the course. Of course with no longer having to train, I was able to manage to get myself up to par but at more stress. My advice, think long and hard about committing to anything during this time. You will definitely benefit from having the extra time. Equipment:Get a second monitor, mouse, and a decent computer if you don't have one. Laptops are good but honestly I feel like the $300 used imac that I bought is so much easier to work on then the macbook pro I worked on for one day. It is a world of difference having to constantly minimize or drag things around just to see your code. Set up your equipment somewhere where you will not having distractions (this will be super important during assessments) but will also help your day to day. I moved my equipment from a second bedroom (with one window) to my living room with 3 because it got more daylight. This made a huge difference in my productivity because I felt the day longer (didn't get tired as easily), could hear birds chirping instead of the neighbor's kids on their trampoline, and could also let my dogs play outside while I monitored them through the window (as opposed to keeping them cooped all day and feeling guilty)! The sunlight also keeps you sane because depending on your time zone you may not actually be outside during daylight otherwise. If you have a savings and are able to invest a bit more a Solid State Drive would be helpful. Make sure you are using an ethernet connection for reliable video signal and consider investing in a inexpensive external microphone. This won't really be enforced but you will make it a better experience for you and your classmates.Read Less",app-academy

Honestly it bothered me more than it should but it definitely took me and my attention away from lectures, as i suck at taking notes. Just imagine trying to follow along to dry code while watching someone give you a lecture Redux. The days i got away with having my laptop in lecture, i was completely focused took incredible notes in notion, and learned a bunch. The days i didn't which was most, i didn't pay attention, i slacked off, and made up for it during pair programming and at night, which was super annoying. If you cant tell already it really bothered me. When it comes to the curriculum, there are parts I definitely disagree with but overall they jam pack you with more than you'll ever be able to grasp all at once. Which is excellent. From high level algorithms to LRU Cache, and hashing functions, to understanding the foundations of a MVC framework. They definitely need to teach hooks in React though, and get away from only teaching class Components. It's out of date, compile rate is way slower and the industry is staying away from class Components, unless its dealing with error handling. They need to teach less ruby and more React. Ruby is a really beautiful but also a really easy language. The amount of time they focus on it is probably better spent elsewhere.Job Support so far is alright, everything seems to out of order though. Not sure where to go or what to do most times.

This curriculum teaches you how to program from scratch starting with Ruby, then SQL, Ruby on Rails, Javascript and finally React &amp; Redux. I came into this program with... Read More prior programming experience, so the first month of so was basically review to me while most of my peers were learning the basics of programming. I can say that I came away from this course as a better programmer, and fully equipped with the tools necessary to find a job as a software developer. The pace is very fast - you're learning something new every day. It ramps up in speed - we spent the first month working with Ruby, and at the end we went through the Javascript curriculum in only a week. The pair programming experience is great - 95% of my classmates were there to learn and were motivated. You'll be doing pair programming for 10 weeks with a new person everyday, so at the end of it you make some pretty good friends and networking connections out of it. 95% of the stuff you learn is useful; you end up using most of it for the 3 projects at the end that you are required to do. The instructors are great and all of them are there to help you succeed and do better.I am currently in the job search curriculum portion, where I get lectures on topics such as networking, writing cover letters and resumes, and interviewing. After I graduate, I will be working with a career coach from App Academy for upwards of a year until I find a job. Once you graduate, it doesn't stop - they expect you to spend 8 hours a day, 40 hours of week working on finding a job. If you work better with imposed deadlines, then this is immensely helpful as it prevents you from procrastinating. Overall - I think that the program is worth the value in tuition. I would recommend payment upfront rather than the deferred model, since you pay less and there's less pressure to find a job after you graduate. But if you like that sort of pressure, then maybe the second option is better for you after all. If I could do it over, I'd definitely attend App Academy again.Read Less",app-academy

What I love most about App Academy is that despite my prior experience in programming, I was constantly challenged and learned something new each... Read More day. The curriculum is rich enough that even the more experienced programmers will feel like they're getting something out of it. I can't recommend this program enough for those that are looking for a bootcamp. However, my main suggestion is that prior to applying or even considering this bootcamp, you should learn to code. I know this sounds counterintuitive, but the purpose of a bootcamp is not just to teach you how to code, it's to help get a job to build a career. In addition, learning to code prior gives you a sense on whether or not you even enjoy learning how to code. If you do, then definitely put in some time to learn prior to applying. It not only prepares you for the admissions interview but also will help you immensely in the program. App Academy is incredibly competitive and while there are many people that come into this program with little to no knowledge of how to code and ultimately succeed, there are many that don't make it pass the first few weeks. This is simply because the program has a strike out policy where if they deem that you're too far behind in their expectations of where you should be, you could get dismissed. App Academy is a great investment and I highly recommend that those that are considering this program will also consider the time and commitment. Everyone will do whatever it takes to make sure that you learn the material and get that job but only if you're willing to do your part in that process as well.Pros:• Rich curriculum of learning full-stack development and job searching • Has career coaches that work extensively to help you find a job • Relatively affordable: for those that can't pay the entire tuition out of pocket, the deferred plan is a great option that asks for a deposit and a fraction of your first year's income. This is a great choice because other bootcamps have policies that extend over 1 year and the repayment is little compared to what you'll be making as a software engineer. • Learn by doing: The curriculum emphasizes learning by doing. So you'll be working on a lot of projects but don't worry. The projects are not expected to be completed. They're meant to be for YOUR learning experience.Cons:• San Francisco is expensive. If you don't live in San Francisco, expect to dedicate some time commuting to and from the campus (SF traffic sucks). • Doesn't necessarily take into account everyone's learning style. I learn better when I'm coding along with someone but lectures don't allow for computers so it's difficult to pay attention when I have to write notes with pen and paper while trying to follow lecture slides. • Too much pair programming: App Academy focuses on pair programming to get students to learn how to communicate and work with partners. This style is the majority of the program. It would be nice if we had more days to work by ourselves to learn the material at our own pace.Read Less",app-academy

However, it is very rewarding in the end and you gain so much knowledge in such a short amount of time. Here are some personal tips and key points that I picked up from my experience at App Academy (Please note that this is from MY experience, and people accomplish/approach things in different ways):1. App Academy is challenging, but not INSANELY challenging. In my experience, I was able to keep up with App Academy's curriculum while maintaining some social/personal life. Other people say that they dedicate every day, every hour, every minute to App Academy (which is fine), but I felt that there was more free time than initially expected. I would be able to spend my Saturdays and sometimes Sundays doing social/personal stuff, and I honestly felt that this was needed.2. SLEEP is important. The instructors at App Academy can't stress this enough either. I think the thing that kept my stress level low and made my experience enjoyable was the fact that I forced myself to sleep with my regular schedule (I slept at 10:30pm and woke up at 7:30am everyday). I never felt tired during the working hours and I was still able to keep up with the curriculum.3. You have to put in the effort to maintain this healthy lifestyle. The only reason why I was able to have fun on the weekends and get 8-9 hours of sleep everyday was the fact that I worked hard during the working hours. It's just as they say - work hard, play hard. If you actually pay attention during the lectures and actually put in your effort during the projects, you'll be able to absorb the information better, especially if you're not tired or stressed. My previous advice isn't to show that App Academy is easy, it's to show that there is a way to maintain good health and a happy lifestyle while going through the rigorous curriculum.Read Less",app-academy

You just can't get the reputation a 4 year degree will get you at a bootcamp. Especially considering how undergraduate internships are the new start of the pipeline to full time employment. The job search portion is arguably more grueling due to financial stress and comparative lack of structure.

I... Read More have a roommate attending Hack Reactor (HR) and my understanding is that HR is equivalent to the second half of App Academy. In practice, this means you lose out on learning a second language (Some companies, such as Google, care about how many languages you learn) and do not learn databases or CSS as deeply.If you are wondering whether you are a good fit for App Academy, I would follow the advice of those before me and go through Harvard's computer science Edx program before attending. It is not imperative that you fully understand everything from that course, but a general idea of the concepts helped me excel at App Academy. I came from a political science background, but I understood programming concepts thanks to predicate logic, the Harvard Edx course, and from video games. So, you do not need extensive knowledge of coding, but attending App Academy without some exposure is a mistake.The program itself is rather rigorous and you will find that you live under a rock for the duration of it. Our cohort had the easiest time because our program aligned with several holidays. Nevertheless, I found myself skipping my normal gym routine in favor of late-night studying. The most telling part of the workload was when I caught the flu and missed an entire week at App Academy. During that time, I still did the work, on my own, and turned it in to avoid strikes (Yes, you get strikes while sick). I often thought I could rest and make up for lost time later that night, but when I compared my pace to my classmates, I found that not only were they working while I was resting, but even during the hours I felt I could pull ahead. Simply put, there is no escaping the time-sink involved in this type of program. When we finished the material and began personal projects, I found myself running on four hours of sleep per night.How enjoyable the experience is will largely depend on your fellow students. I felt as if I shared a lot of experiences with my cohort and that they made the experience enjoyable. It is impossible for me to say whether other cohorts will be as exceptional. You will find yourself interacting with at least half the cohort due to paired programming and your breaks will be spent discussing the material. Personally, I enjoyed pair programming since I value the time I spend with my cohort, but some people felt it was not as enjoyable -- it really depends on your preferences. My biggest criticisms of this program are its strike policy and location. As previously mentioned, you accrue strikes while sick and that inclined people to attend class, with the flu, during my time at App Academy. My other criticism is that it is located in rather expensive places. It might not be feasible to relocate, but New York and San Francisco are infamously expensive locations and are not necessarily the nicest places (In terms of cleanliness). Be prepared to budget if you attend. I know some people mitigate this cost by traveling from afar, but given the tedium of the program, I would highly advice against it.Overall, I think the program pushes acquainted individuals to become great software engineers.I wouldn't recommend it to people with zero exposure to coding, but a little preparation will alleviate that concern. I was surprised to read that professional developers are paying to learn material App Academy teaches such as React and Redux. I often impressed my software engineer friends when I told them what we learned/were learning, so I believe the curriculum is rather exceptional.Read Less",app-academy

The guidance of the teaching assistants and the camaraderie of other students provide a great learning environment that will push you to stay on track.Now for some criticisms. This bootcamp will teach you very basic fundamentals early on and then transition quickly into being focused on frontend web development. The practical skills taught are all in frontend frameworks. This is great to train students to be able to jump into a junior frontend role and be productive, but not so great if you desire to work backend. Now of course a/A is just providing the building blocks to launch students into a career in software development and students can certainly transition into a backend role, but it likely won't be the first job after a/A. The program is 16 weeks and can not replace a CS degree. A lot of self-study is necessary right after the program ends to shore up deficiencies in the data structures and algorithms.As for the SF campus, the building is located in Financial District / Embarcadero which means rent will be very expensive if you want to live nearby. If you are moving to SF, look for housing right away after being accepted and see if you can find a roommate with a fellow student in the cohort. The equipment on campus is adequate but some upgrades could be made with the office chairs. Having your own relatively modern laptop is a must.All in all, I am very pleased with what I've gained through App Academy in the last 4 months.

App Academy is the most time consuming and stressful thing I have done in the last few years(And that includes starting a business). My cohort started with around 25 people... In the end, there were only... Read More 10 of us left(including a coder that was rolled back into our group). Even though App Academy hours are from 8 am - 5 pm pacific time, there is usually a few hours of homework and readings every night as well. I usually found myself going to bend around midnight to 2 am studying every night since I was in central time.In addition there are six assessments which you must score around an 85% to 90% or better in order to pass or after two fails you may be asked to leave the program. So between studying for these assessments to remain in the program, doing the nightly homework videos, readings and coding projects where you are expected to take on and learn new content, and the daily grind of 8 am to 5 pm (or 10 am to 7 pm if you are in the mid-west), and any ongoing projects or other fun homework that might be assigned, you might find yourself incredibly busy.During the week it is pretty much impossible to find time to get out or do anything social. I made sure to keep myself active though and workout daily. I think the assessments create a very stressful learning environment for the students and aren't a good measure of a coders ability. I saw many coders very stressed about the upcoming assessments. For some this brings out the best and motivates people to do better. For others, they would simply self-destruct.What I love about App Academy is that it has taught me to think like a coder instead of having to resort to copy and paste or following tutorials to create websites, write backends, set up API endpoints, create games, or manage the flow of an app. I feel confident that I can build anything or learn any new kind of technology stack very quickly and use the thought process that I have gained from App Academy. I was bummed at first that they taught Ruby as I consider it a dying language(Yes Ruby is still in demand). Even though it has many easy and useful and methods that can making coding much faster and simpler, it appears that it is not being used nearly as much by companies as Javascript, Python, Java, and some other languages. (By the way App Academy is switching to Python and I am excited to get access to their content). However, App Academy taught me Javascript as well, React, the MERN stack with MongoDB. I learned GraphQL, docker, postresql, how to make GeoQueries, organize my code better, and take advantage of object oriented programming. I mastered algorithms, recursion, data structures, became great at debugging and learned many other things.Their curriculum is on a whole other level from what you will usually find. If you complete the course, you will a deep understanding of algorithms, data structures, how servers work, requests, responses, big-O, LRU cache, optimizations and many other things. We did things like creating our own version of Rails Active Record to see how Ruby on Rails worked behind the scenes. We did the same thing with JQuery. Once again, its more than just copy and paste. It's real understanding that you can take to any other endeavor.And what I have found, when picking up a new language, framework or stack, is that the thought process is pretty much the same. I have been able to teach myself Dart to make mobile apps in Flutter and pick up python very quickly just using the techniques and knowledge that I gained from App Academy.The Instructors are excellent, brilliant problem solvers, very knowledgeable and almost always available, even on the weekends or if you have a late night question.I am currently about to start the Job Search phase, so we will see how this converts to finding a job. However, I feel very confident in my abilities. Would I have put in 19 hours a day in coding for 6 months without App Academy? Probably not. App Academy also gave me streamlined curriculum to be prepared for the job search and and to be ready to build anything, instead of wasting my time on many youTube videos or Udemy courses that aren't useful don't help you to actually learn to solve problems like a coder.Even beyond the job search, this has definitely changed my life, since I have many website and app ideas, and now I possess the skills to bring them into reality. I am no longer unsure where to start or how to attack a problem. App Academy has helped to break down problems and return solutions.I do wish they went more into design. But I found myself getting very strong at design by working on the projects at the end of the course.Read Less",app-academy

Course work is really relevant and tailored to languages and frameworks that are considered relevant/trendy in the industry, as well as plenty of attention given to theory/algorithms/more theoretical material that will help in interviews, as well as just general programming knowledge. Big focus on Ruby/Rails in the beginning, with a hard shift to JavaScript about halfway. Will feel very comfortable with both by the end. You are very on your own for the projects. Instructors will help with large bugs, but other than that, you pretty much utilize what you learned in the previous 12 weeks of the course. Speaking of instructors, they essentially hire the most well rounded ~2 students from every cohort, so they're an amazing resource for help and advice. Overall, amazing experience and would recommend to anyone who is looking to change their career/get their start in software development. I feel very prepared in regards to the languages /frameworks i've learned here, but also things like OOD, TTD, algorithm and database design, etc.Read Less",app-academy

Read More a bit of context I am a 21 year old high school dropout that didn't finish the 10th grade and was in and out of homeless/domestic violence shelters with my mom and sisters. sufficient to say we missed a lot of school. My son was born when I was 16, married my high-school sweetheart at 17, and my daughter was born when I was 19. The point is that there was there was every reason for me to think that I wasn't good enough to have the title Software Engineer. However, 3 weeks ago I finished the 24 week online course and can say with a high degree of certainty that I will land a job in the next few months (Will update onChange). This is not say that the course is not hard. It was the single hardest thing that I have ever done. When they say 100 hours a week they mean it. I personally did at least 16 hour days 7 days a week for 20 weeks( throughout the main part of the course). Did many all nighters and even more 20 hour days to stay caught up. Basically if i wasn't sleeping/eating I was studying. App Academy doesn't just teach you all of the skills to be a successful Software Engineer, as corny as it is to say they really do teach you how to learn. The very dedicated,patient and knowledgeable T.As brake vary hard concepts down to the absolute base foundation, then start building on it at a pase that is continously pushing you passed what you thought was your limit. I would like to take the chance to shine a light on a T.A named Trevor. He is a shining example of why App Academy is the best. aA hire's Caring, knowledgeable and relatable engineers to give you the best possible chance. I think I can speak for any/all of my fellow corhotins that regardless of the language/stack/problem, we have the skills to pick up whatever is put in front of us and quickly be able to preform the task at an industry standard level. The Friendships and relationships that I made over the last 6 months will last a lifetime. In conclusion the decision to commit to app academy should not be taken lightly, it definitely lives up to the name bootcamp. I can admit that I was not smartest person in my class but what I lacked in natural intelligence was overwriten by alot of hard work and a very well layed out plan.

I’d say the greatest strengths of the program are the challenge, the support,... Read More and the accountability. The principal three-month curriculum is incredibly intense—expect 60-hour weeks at absolute minimum—but it takes you through the skills and concepts you need to know and forces you to put in the necessary work to really learn them. The instructors and TAs, though they can occasionally be overwhelmed (many are graduates of the course), are always on hand to offer helpful feedback that’s often critical to bringing together your understanding of a concept. It’s all about putting you in a structure that incentivizes you to actually put in the work, and this continues even after graduation, as you get individualized coaching and reporting tools that make sure you regularly apply to jobs and continue working on projects and coding challenges. This is especially valuable because the job search can take time—around three months in my case—and you’ll absolutely have more to learn after you graduate. Twelve weeks can’t cover every nuance of software engineering. As far as downsides, the instruction is sometimes shaky, as I said above, though years in business have polished the curriculum to the point where you’ll usually have pre-prepared resources to help you out if worst comes to worst. Your continued participation in the course depends on you passing the regular assessments, which is a major source of stress even if you have a handle on the material and prepare well. The assessments themselves also can feel more like tests of memorization than genuine reflections of how much you’ve learned. Last but not least, despite App Academy’s stated (and admirable) goal of bringing people from more diverse backgrounds into the tech industry, most of the classes seem to be overwhelmingly male, even more so than the industry as a whole. That won’t be an issue for everybody, but it’s worth mentioning. Still, I have no regrets. It was an extremely valuable learning experience for me and, obviously, it got me a job.Read Less",app-academy

In the 3 months that you dedicate to App Academy, it is essentially... Read More the only thing that you can focus on. However, it is very rewarding in the end and you gain so much knowledge in such a short amount of time. Here are some personal tips and key points that I picked up from my experience at App Academy (Please note that this is from MY experience, and people accomplish/approach things in different ways):1. App Academy is challenging, but not INSANELY challenging. In my experience, I was able to keep up with App Academy's curriculum while maintaining some social/personal life. Other people say that they dedicate every day, every hour, every minute to App Academy (which is fine), but I felt that there was more free time than initially expected. I would be able to spend my Saturdays and sometimes Sundays doing social/personal stuff, and I honestly felt that this was needed.2. SLEEP is important. The instructors at App Academy can't stress this enough either. I think the thing that kept my stress level low and made my experience enjoyable was the fact that I forced myself to sleep with my regular schedule (I slept at 10:30pm and woke up at 7:30am everyday). I never felt tired during the working hours and I was still able to keep up with the curriculum. 3. You have to put in the effort to maintain this healthy lifestyle. The only reason why I was able to have fun on the weekends and get 8-9 hours of sleep everyday was the fact that I worked hard during the working hours. It's just as they say - work hard, play hard. If you actually pay attention during the lectures and actually put in your effort during the projects, you'll be able to absorb the information better, especially if you're not tired or stressed. My previous advice isn't to show that App Academy is easy, it's to show that there is a way to maintain good health and a happy lifestyle while going through the rigorous curriculum. Closing thoughts:I definitely don't know as much as those who dedicated every minute of their lives studying and working on App Academy, but I can confidently say that I was one of the happiest people there and truly enjoyed everyday of my experience with low stress. My approach was all about balance in my life, and I succeeded and made it to the end! Obviously, people work differently. If you need to lose some sleep to catch up on studying, that's fine. If you need even less days to study and can spend all weekend relaxing, that's fine too. I think the main thing is to not worry about what/how others are doing, and only focus on yourself and what YOU need to be successful and healthy.Read Less",app-academy

At times, TAs will have to ask another TA for help to help the student. Curriculum review:As some reviews have already stated, the JavaScript curriculum needs to be more refined. A majority of App Academy grads will find positions as front end developers or become full stack developers but their job will have them primarily do front end stuff. I think, due to this fact, App Academy focuses too much on front end. App Academy is continuously tweaking their program and I hope that they shorten the ruby section and make the JavaScript section more extensive by covering node.js and express.js in depth instead of just focusing on React / Redux. As for CSS and HTML, which App Academy dedicates time to teaching, I think it is better to leave students to learn from the great and free online resources out there. Just assign homework that needs to be completed and turned in to make sure students do the CSS. Culture: App Academy states that it is a professional environment but it is far from it. They will take violations of their diversity and inclusion principles very seriously but besides that, App Academy does not enforce students to keep professional behavior. This leads to a more relaxed environment, which helps the social aspect of the boot camp, but does get in the way of focusing on coding since people are allowed to have loud conversations about any topic they want without consequences. Job search: There seems to be adequate support. Again, because of the number of students accepted to App Academy, there seems to be a shortage in number of job search coaches.Read Less",app-academy

Should you apply for a coding boot camp? I can't give you a straight answer for this because it depends on your situation. But in my... Read More case, it was worth it for me, since my goal was to learn about full-stack web development and software engineering to be as fast as possible. I think App Academy does a great job at that, and you will be surprised at how quickly you can learn here. It would have taken me far longer of self-studying to be where I'm at today. Not to mention, I've also made some great friends along the way that I talk to every day.2. How should one prepare before applying to App Academy? I did the intro-to-programming section offered on https://www.aaonline.io and felt that I was ready to schedule a technical interview with AA. I was not, I failed my first interview and was lucky enough to get invited back for another. After failing, I realized that I needed much more practice. I practiced on https://www.codewars.com every day up until my next interview. You need to time yourself and talk out loud through the problem-solving process, preferably to a friend or family member. You should also be very comfortable working with arrays and hashes in Ruby and solving problems that may require nested loops. Sidenote: https://www.leetcode.com is another excellent place to practice. 3. How many hours per week to get through the program? Like many have said before me, this boot camp is no joke. Even if you put in 80+ hours per week, you will only be scratching the surface of the topics covered. But this is the tradeoff of getting yourself job-ready as fast as possible.4. How stressful is the program? If you have no programming experience, you will need to study hard to pass the six assessments. They cover Ruby algorithms, Ruby Object-Oriented Programming, SQL, Ruby on Rails, React, and JavaScript. If you fail two of the assessment tests, you must retake one of their choosing. If you fail the retake test, you will be booted out. Yes, it's stressful, but keep your focus on the material and the great job that you're going to get out of it, and you'll be fine.5. How is the curriculum? I think that some of the newer content at the end of the curriculum could use some improvement. But for the most part, it's fantastic. I know some people may be turned off by Ruby and Ruby on Rails, but don't worry about it, you will also build full-stack applications with the MERN stack.6. How are the instructors? From my experience, they were knowledgable and friendly. Leave the ego at the door and pick their brains as much as possible. They are a valuable resource. 7. What is a day like at App Academy? At 8 AM we would meet on Zoom, the instructors would cover the daily material before splitting us up into random pairs to work on the day's projects. Throughout the day, we had access to the instructors to ask them questions. About an hour before the end of the day, we would all meet to cover the material in the day's project. Before the next day, we would then complete the assigned homework.Great experience and I would do it again.Read Less",app-academy

Right off the bat once the immersive portion kicked into high gear, we got exposure to Git, data structures,... Read More and we were pair programming daily through the day’s projects. The curriculum is well structured for layering in new technologies, and before you know it you’re familiar with relational databases and doing a deep dive into the inner workings of Rails. Things move at a bewildering pace, and it’s very easy to get caught off guard by this early on if you’re not careful. The looming thought of getting kicked out over failing two assessments can be extremely unsettling, but this risk/reward setup also puts the entirety of the cohort into a hyper focused mindset. And it creates a unique environment for learning if you can sublimate the anxiety of it. Even through the online setup, it was surprising just how much there was a sense of community. You spend hours every day with your classmates, and even through a computer screen I felt like I got to know a lot of them really well. I don’t know how they’re able to isolate so many brilliant people into these cohorts, but they clearly have very efficient and calculated screening mechanisms in place to ensure they’re taking quality people into the program. The TA’s are fantastic. The student to teacher ratio is very favorable for student teacher interactions, and they were consistently pivotal in getting me on track with the material on pace to get through the assessments. It’s a lot of information so be 100% prepared to have no life while you’re working through the curriculum. I thought 100 hours a week would be an exaggeration but I was consistently logging 95-100 hours each week studying the material straight through the weekend. You get to build your own full stack project using the core stack of the curriculum, as well as other projects with additional technologies that you learn past the React portion of the course. They’re in a re-vamping phase with their curriculum with less of a focus on Ruby as far as I understand, so this is something to bear in mind moving forward. I’m confident that however they re-structure the curriculum will be just as effective as the current setup they have in place and I’m sure it’s necessary given the industry’s trending away from Rails, but any large scale overhaul of a curriculum carries with it at least some amount of risk. I felt like the React portion was great. Past that things were still mostly well structured with minor hiccups. There were portions I felt were too rushed. For example, we had about a weekend to learn the MERN stack before we were working in a team to build an application in it that following week. Pieces of this curriculum might need some revision. Maybe something as simple as having at least one additional project with the MERN stack before having students code in a team environment in it. However I really enjoyed the Docker portion of the curriculum, and it was fun building an additional project with GraphQL / Apollo. I’ve heard this part of the curriculum is at the moment isolated to the online setups. You get to build a project in Vanilla JavaScript at the end of the course as well. App Academy’s deferred payment plan was a strong draw for me personally. I felt that this established them as an institution willing to take on a lot of risk investing in the people they take into the program, and shows that they’re confident their curriculum will get people placed in well-paying positions upon finishing. I’d honestly like to see more institutions of higher education adopt a similar financing approach. There are pros and cons to deciding on doing the online setup instead of an in-person setup, and I do believe an in-person setup would have been very fulfilling. Some people would say the in person setup is vital to the whole App Academy experience. But I do like that the online setup at least had a longer space of time for absorbing the material. You get a month prior to the official immersive portion of the cohort to get solid with software engineering fundamentals. And the TA’s were always readily available to answer any questions I might have, so at least on the learning side there was nothing lost in translation going this route. An in person bootcamp really wasn’t feasible for me personally, and I would expect it’s not for many others planning on applying.

Tests are challenging but are 100% covered by the material you learn and you're always given ample time to study and ask questions if you're feeling uneasy.My background was in physics and mathematics prior, and I have to admit strong mathematics skills can really help, not to mention a lot of the prior coding experience I had. But don't let that get you down, the aces of our cohort either disliked math and/or had no prior experience in programming and still ended up coming out on top!My only complaint is that the course felt a little rushed towards the last few weeks. Luckily by that point you'll be a veteran and have no problem using the skills you've picked up to fill in the gaps. This program is rigorous and will genuinely consume your life when you're in the midst of it, but it's well worth your commitment.Read Less",app-academy

There were never any "trick" questions. I definitely felt that they wanted me to succeed, but as I stressed earlier, I prepared my butt off for them.I felt not so positively about a few things. 1. Towards one point in the curriculum, live lectures with your TAs got taken over by instructional videos. Even though we paused the videos to go over any questions, it was degrees of magnitude less engaging compared to when we were live doing it all together. 2. As soon as we got into the Career Quest portion of the curriculum, things seemed to have derailed in terms of organization. Our TAs didn't seem to know what was on the schedule, especially towards the beginning of the Career Quest curriculum. 3. Add a search functionality to the curriculum materials!! Especially during full stack projects, I needed to refer back to materials on how to do one specific thing and it was so difficult without a search. 4.

Read More local community college, and a few of UC Berkeley's online Software Development Certificate classes (none of which I personally recommend, but that's a story for another day). Once I had decided that the bootcamp path was one I would take, I began the arduous task of selecting the RIGHT bootcamp. Ultimately, I decided that an in-person program was the right fit for my learning style. Living in the SF Bay Area, there seemed to be two choices. I asked friends and family, that work in the tech industry, to take a look at the syllabi, read all the reviews, and had a few sleepless nights. I ultimately chose App Academy as the school I wanted to attend, participated in their online bootcamp prep program, and a few months later I was rewarded with acceptance into their program. Then the really difficult part began . . .  This program is intense, it's designed that way and they make no apologies about it. You are forced to constantly learn new material, never truly feeling comfortable before the next topic is laid before you. A week into the course, I was sure that I would not make it. I came home everyday to my wife and told her that I had no idea what was going on, that I was barely hanging on, that many other people surely had a better grasp of the material and I was doomed. I spent hours each day after class and every weekend up at the school, working on homework or studying for assessments. App Academy is quick to point out that almost everyone has these feelings, and it's Imposter Syndrome in full effect. They chose you for a reason, they say. You are supposed to be here. For myself, these feelings of inadequacy continued through the course. Though you do get comfortable with a general feeling of unease and helplessness. I will also say, that despite these feelings, I did feel supported throughout the program. I could ask questions whenever I wanted, help was available from TAs and my fellow students. The bonds formed in this stressful situation, and the assistance that you are able to both receive and give to those around you helps keep you grounded and headed towards the finish line. I've heard a lot of talk about the structure of Assessments, and the policy of being asked to leave if you fail 2 of them. Is the system perfect? No, it is not. Is fear an amazing motivator? Yes, it certainly is. Is watching good, hardworking, smart people walk out the doors early a painful experience? Without a doubt. Is there a better way to do it? I truly don't know. But that is the process that App Academy has chosen, so just know what you are getting into. If you are not able to calm yourself down in extremely stressful testing situations, these tests are going to be hard. But, if you do the work, if you go over the practice tests and make attempts to understand the material to the best of your ability, if you are honest with yourself about the information you do not understand and ask questions, you will be fine. If I made it through, you can too. As I write this, I am at the end of the program, with just a few days left. The Job Search part of the program is much different than the instructional portion. There is much less structure, the occasional lecture on soft skills, networking, reumés, interviewing questions, and further work on some algorithms and data structures. Some people enjoy this portion, some hate it. Some feel abandoned, some use it to finally focus on what they really find interesting. I don't really have any issues with it. I'm happy to be provided with the school's perspective on how to get a job in a very competitive industry, but the quick switch from an extremely structured environment to one where you drive the process can have one feeling lonely. In the end though, you are the only one responsible for your career and you have to start providing yourself with motivation and guidance at some point in time. Overall, I can honestly say that I would make the decision to come back to App Academy again. I have learned invaluable skills, and I have a path to a job doing something that I love. There is still a lot of work left to do. I will have to go back and dive deeper into nearly all of the concepts covered in the course. I don't believe that most people come out able to get a job the next day, but I would never have made the progress that I did without the rigor and stress that came along with the program. The bootcamp experience is definitely not for everyone. But if you do chose to take this path, I believe that you will find it very rewarding. As others have stated, and in the interest of full disclosure, I am being offered a sweatshirt as motivation for writing a review. I believe everything that I have written, and it is my honest assessment of the program and my experience in it. Best of luck in your search, and in making a life altering decision.

The rest of the TAs, some more experienced than others, did a fine job of designing/delivering our daily lectures as well as helping us all out on the floor each afternoon while we tackled our pair-programming assignments. CONS:Absence of Feedback --&gt; As a new student, you'll be required to provide daily feedback on a variety of topics: quality of the curriculum, how well your pair-programming experiences go, your satisfaction level related to the support of your TAs, etc... and yet (to my knowledge) none of us ever received a single piece of feedback in return. I was very vocal about my desire for someone with experience to review my code or even my progress at any point in the curriculum... sadly, this did not come to fruition. If I'm honest, App Academy did not faithfully deliver on the expectations it set regarding the amount of support we would receive throughout the program. There were times when I was either seriously concerned about my own performance or extremely frustrated with aspects of the curriculum, but no one representing the program ever extended an opportunity to have a conversation about this. Excessive emphasis on passing assessments --&gt; Expect to take tests constantly (at least 1x / week for the first six weeks, not including practice exams). As of this moment, if you fail more than 2 exams, you risk getting dismissed from the program. The pressure was extremely high for almost all of us leading up to the assessments; we were concerned for ourselves and the possibility of losing the friends that we became close with. While I don't have a problem with designing a system to ensure that students are keeping up with the course material, I do seriously question each test's ability to accurately (or even roughly) gauge a student's understanding of the material. In hindsight, it felt like a lot of success was derived from a combination of memorizing code and test-taking strategies that were aimed to prioritize passing unit tests (i.e. scoring points) over genuine understanding of the course material... this last point being especially frustrating because it lies in direct contrast to App Academy's emphasis on prioritizing understanding over finishing assignments / projects. Poorly designed online educational materials --&gt; Over time, I found myself increasingly frustrated by the quality of App Academy's online educational materials. As a full-time in-person student, you will rely on this online program to supplement the daily lectures and help you complete the daily homework assignments. As a visual / tactile learner, I have no problem admitting that I regularly found myself completely discouraged by App Academy's approach to online learning: giant blocks of dense (often highly technical) text, static (non-interactive) code-snippets, poorly edited videos with outdated material, UI that lacks search functionality, etc... and you'll frequently find topics that App Academy decides to send you elsewhere on the Internet to learn about. HTML / CSS education needs (a lot of ) love --&gt; I would not recommend App Academy's HTML / CSS education above any of the most well-known and freely available resources on the internet. The curriculum peppers in bite-size doses of these topics with several half-hour projects &amp; only 1 lecture entirely devoted to CSS. Almost all of us reached intermediate levels of competency in these topics exclusively through self-learning while working on our full-stack projects.Insufficient guidance --&gt; This criticism is specific to the back-half of the curriculum, when you'll transition to working on projects and preparing for your inevitable job search. Some examples come to mind: the shortage of TAs to support our cohort and the lack of organization / awareness / preparation regarding project-related lectures &amp; availability of related online resources. I would also recommend regular check-ins between coaches and students in either a small group setting or 1 on 1 (if time permits); the program can often feel like such a whirlwind and the burden is so often laid on the backs of the students to figure things out themselves... I can't speak for everyone, but I would feel SO much better at least having the perception that there's someone here that is willing to actively guide me instead of just passively being available in the shadows. Final Thoughts:Though this opinion is subject to change once I leave the program and make my way through the job search... despite all my criticisms (no bootcamp is perfect), I have ZERO regrets about enrolling in this program. It challenged me to grow in ways I have never experienced in an academic or professional setting. It gifted me some amazing new friendships and connections that I'm extremely grateful to walk away with. It's worth noting that bootcamps are absolutely not made for everyone... the firehosing of information, the lack of sleep, the pressure, the impostor syndrome... this can often feel like an extremely stressful environment (on your body and your mind)... but if you're up for the challenge, this could very well change your life.Read Less",app-academy

I do have specific issues with the program, but as you attempt to weigh those against the first sentence, remember that no bootcamp, no undergrad, no educational... Read More program will ever be perfect. You know the old adage 'you get out what you put in?' App Academy will absolutely convert your effort into the desired result.One piece of advice that I don't think is specific to App Academy: only compare yourself to yourself. I guarantee there will plenty of people who seem smarter or better at everything. Ignore them. Only you know if you're putting in the time, if you're staying engaged throughout the day, if you're holding yourself accountable to be the best that you can be. Do your best and the rest will take care of itself.PROS: - The staff - the TAs (catchall term for instructors) are uniformly knowledgeable and excited to teach. Nearly every lecture was well presented, well communicated, and directly relevant to the material. - The material - the curriculum is rigorous and challenging. Many of the projects that we struggled through in the first weeks will make valuable portfolio additions when we go back and attack them with everything we've learned.  The rhythm for most of the curriculum section is learn material - &gt; assessment -&gt; pivot to new material. This can give you a feeling of whiplash, but what remains constant is the idea that you 'always be learning.' I feel much better equipped to learn new things in a short period of time than I think I would have had the transitions been more gradual and forgiving. - General culture - For 12 weeks the fellow students in your cohort will be your allies both in learning and life. Nobody else will really understand what it's like to go through the program. This might be specific to my cohort, but from what I've seen of other cohorts the sentiment holds true. Beyond that though, the general culture, the interaction between students and students, students and staff, and aA employee culture are all just really positive, really goal oriented and at the same time really forgiving. - Project phase - After the curriculum, you'll work on projects. Working on full stack projects was just a fantastic way to tie together all the things we'd spent the last 8 weeks learning. There is, however, a somewhat stark drop off in how much help you'll get from staff from the course curriculum phase to the project phase.CONS: Feedback void - Every day you'll be required to give feedback on your partner for the day, and several times throughout the course you'll be asked for feedback on the experience as a whole. At no point was I given any indication that my feedback was considered. Several times throughout the course I specifically asked to hear the general sentiment of feedback people were leaving about me, and I got no response (beyond 'yes we can do that' but then nothing). To be clear, I do believe that feedback I left was at least read by human eyes, but that's just a hunch because again, communication was an entirely one way street of me to anonymous form. Further, beyond assessments testing basic functionality of your code, there is no feedback around code style, code smell, or overall code practices. The code we're exposed to in the project skeletons and demo is generally good and tightly written, but there's no checking to see if any of that has sunk in. I was particularly disappointed by this because on day 1 a TA made a point of saying that aA graduates write more readable, cleaner code than CS graduates, but then there was just no system in place to ensure that.As far as I know no human ever evaluated the quality of my code. Maybe the lesson there is, 'if it works, it works' but that seems short sighted and not in keeping with the idea of producing quality software developers.I'm resisting leaving feedback on the job search section because I'm in the middle of it now. That said, thus far we've covered basic algorithms and data structure in greater depth than we did during the curriculum. We've worked on our resumes, our personal pitch, and what to expect from the whole process. I think I won't know the true value of the job search support until some time after the program.PS I did a fair amount of research into various bootcamps before I decided on aA. Obviously my experience is limited to the one I choose, but investigated Hack Reactor, General Assembly, and Berkeley Boot camp in addition to aA. Of those, only Hack Reactor seemed up to the same level as aA.Read Less",app-academy

It is absolutely in that ballpark. Of course, it's different for everyone and some topics will come easier to some folks. I didn't find that I was spending 90 hours every single week, but the time really begins to add up quickly between the 45-minute commute there, morning lecture time from 9 AM - 12:15 PM, afternoon pair programming from 1:30 PM to 6 PM, another 45-minute commute home, and then any required readings, videos, and homework for the following day's material which could often take up to 3 or 4 hours.

As other reviews have mentioned, the assessments are not easy but they are always very fair. It is definitely not subjective in any way and assessments are graded solely based on how many test specs you can get to pass before time runs out. The quantity of material you need to know for any individual test is large and studying will sometimes feel insurmountable. However, it is absolutely possible for every person in the cohort to get a perfect score since the tests are not designed to trick you or test you on something you weren't explicitly told to study for.Anyone who isn't scared off by the absolutely massive scale of the curriculum and the short timeframe you're afforded to cram it all into your brain in a useable way will be rewarded with an incredible toolkit and the confidence to apply for any software developer job.

Read More I don’t know why they say that but it’s probably rooted at the top level. This is what you need to know.To get into App Academy it will be pretty hard to just apply and pray...you need to Study. If you do study than look for the app academy problems online or go on GitHub(entry level) and search for them. Jumpstart can help if your background is weak(only couple months), but I certainly noticed an edge for those who did Boot Camp Prep(I didn’t and I was a little envious). So who Am I ? Well I just graduated Today...take my review with respect to that aspect of App Academy’s curriculum. Reviewing them is a little tough because everyone is different, some people pick it up faster(I’m diligent so it’s at what I call a normal pace) and others pick it up faster, but those people which will be in Your cohort have some type of strong technical background most likely. The tests are hard and it is true you can’t tell which one is the hardest normally due to the differences in people. They will overwork you on purpose and try to see if you can pass because if you can’t they want you to fail out. Part of the reason is the last ten days of the main part of the curriculum they let you work on the full stack, but it’s an extremely expensive operation and probably not profitable for them if you can’t do the basics of coding. Not to mention once you start the Full Stack project you need to be able to do it mostly on your own so you can put it on your Resume and say “I did that.” The best part? The Teacher assistants without a doubt. I was actually surprised at home many there are(around six plus the main instructor). The teacher assistants are highly skilled and during the course you will likely learn the most from them more than anything else. When you put it all together App Academy’s program is very good and costs quite a bit of capital to run, remember these teacher assistants are paid well. A couple of last notes. They are now like a well oiled machine. They hire in advance, train the next leaders before they leave, prep the next cohort as soon as you start yours, and they do not stop for whatever reason.....in App academy there are no days off and they work through almost all holidays. If you want to go to App Academy I recommend it. Better if you can pair it with a degree, but standalone it’s good too. If I was you and you were accepted I would not hangout on the weekends. I went to a wedding one day and felt behind the entire course because of it. There’s so much homework that catching up is really hard and the weekends are for studying the tests since it’s pointless to do the homework if you can’t pass the test. Overall four stars because of the lack of support for stressed out individuals. They say talk to us, but it’s not very inviting and I took it as a clue for an opportunity for them to say to you “this course is not for everyone.”Read Less",app-academy

Most of the project work you complete before your fullstackproject will not actually be usable for portfolios, although it will teach you a lot.You will not always get a good pair, although almost everyone you work with will becomeyour closest friends for the next 12 weeks.

Though I ended up with a job I'm thrilled with ~2 months after graduation, the following is information I wish I had known going in.... Read MoreApp Academy's curriculum is first-class. Though it's now freely available online, I found that working through the material in-person with instructor and peer support allowed me to work way harder and learn 100X more effectively than if I had done it on my own. There are a few minor nits to pick with the curriculum (my two cents: not enough vanilla Javascript and React without Redux, too much into to programming stuff), but the staff is incredibly receptive to feedback and changes requested by my cohort are already being implemented in subsequent cohorts. I initially disliked the pair-programming part of the program, but I came around after a few weeks. I do think forcing yourself to communicate your thoughts is the best way to learn and avoid tricking your brain into thinking you know something you don't. Though it's exhausting to do this all day every day, especially if you're an introvert. The rigor of the program is well-documented in other reviews, although I found this pace fun rather than stressful. I devoted ~80 hours a week on average to the program, up to ~100 on intense project weeks. Though controversial, I personally like the assessments as part of the curriculum. I found they kept the pace moving and incentivized learning quite well. Overall, I had an absolute blast during the coding portion of a/A. One thing that's critical to note is that most of these reviews were written after completing the coding portion of the curriculum (week 9), but before the job search curriculum (weeks 10-12) or the actual job search. At that point I would have been similarly enthusiastic, but I think most of the negatives of App Academy surface after week 9.The job search curriculum attempted to balance 2 more projects (one with a totally new tech stack), a primer on algorithms and data structures, behavioral preparation, and application materials (resumes etc.). In my opinion, all of these missed the mark. The MERN stack and algorithms projects/lectures were perfunctory and insufficient. The non-technical portions were mainly common sense to anyone who has been through an interview process before (though there are students at a/A who haven't, so this material may have been helpful to them). On top of this, all of these disparate pieces were done in parallel, making it impossible to focus on any of them. I think doing them serially would have been far more effective.As difficult as the program is, the job search afterwards is 1000X harder. Though demand for developers is as high as ever, demand for junior developers seems to have taken a nosedive over the past few years. Entry-level dev jobs are hard to come by, and competition for them is fierce due to the high volume of cookie-cutter bootcamp grads out there. App Academy offers guidance on how to navigate this tough market, but it feels like an arms race and I have serious doubts about how long a/A will be able to keep its stats where they are. It's also not really accurate to consider this a 12-week program. Though instruction only lasts for 12 weeks, most students will need to spend significant time self-studying (JS and web for frontend, algorithms and data structures for backend and fullstack). In my opinion a/A's 12 weeks are plenty sufficient to become a competent junior developer, but the reality of the job market right now is that you will likely have to go well beyond this to get hired, even if you're a top performer in the program.A few things I wish I'd known about placements: The vast majority of App Academy grads end up at startups. Students do get placed at bigger companies occasionally, but this is uncommon. Students with work histories, degrees, and demographics more aligned with industry demand will, in general, have an easier time finding jobs, though counterexamples do exist. Salaries seem to be more or less as advertised. I expected more out of a/A in terms of pipelines and company partnerships - they do have a few (&lt;5) and are working on more, but expect to do almost all of the heavy lifting yourself.Note that many of these issues are not necessarily unique to a/A but are present across the bootcamp industry. Though a/A's job search curriculum could use some work and the job search is infinitely more difficult than advertised, I had an absolute blast going through App Academy and ended up with an offer I am thrilled with. I would recommend App Academy to anyone who has the mind for the material and the stomach for the job search.Read Less",app-academy

Read More curriculum is very good and focuses on exactly what you need to know. There are many instances where the program teaches students the "under the hood" workings of some built in function or program so that you understand the base functionality before moving on to actually using the tools themselves to do the hard part. Essentially, my point is that it's very in-depth and the TAs (teaching assistants) are very supportive as well, providing daily lectures and answering any questions students might have as they work on their projects throughout the week. The only complaint I really had was the homework. The homework is optional but it's a good idea to do it as often as one can so as to enter the following day with a good grasp of the material that will follow. It is, however, very frustrating, oftentimes with vague directions and few satisfactory results. It's very difficult to end a full day of coding with homework on new material that isn't always explained very effectively. I personally skipped many days of homework just so I could go to sleep with some peace of mind rather than feeling frustrated and stressed. At the very least, I did always do the readings and videos that were assigned. The other thing I would mention is that this is mostly a learning by doing type of curriculum. Different learning styles aren't really taken into account here. There are lectures and readings, but primarily, coding is hands-on material and there's no way around that. Students should definitely expect to put in 80 hours a week (including the 45 hours that one must be in attendance) minimum during this bootcamp if they want to succeed. If one puts in the time and devotion for the full 10 weeks, then they will be web developers and they will find a job, plain and simple.

What I mean by that is that IT IS intense. You will be stressed out by the amount of work you have to do, the lack of time (or at least the feeling of it) and ultimately the strictness... Read More that is enforced.There is a device &amp; attendance strike system (that could lead to dismissal) to make sure people aren't being distracted by their phones, laptops, whatever instead of doing their work. This can be a pro or a con depending on your perspective. They WILL dismiss you if you fail 2 of the 6 assessments that happen within the first 5-1/2 weeks. Curriculum topics change every 1 to 1.5 weeks. If you're completely new to programming, there isn't much time to deeply absorb the topics before moving on to another one.From a materials standpoint, some of the videos, articles, and information that they use is between 3-5 years old. That's ancient in the world of tech. At times, the instructions used in pair programming or for the projects (or the homework) can be vague &amp; unintentionally (or intentionally?) misleading. Often times I was frustrated by how little focus the work presented seemed to have.There were a few times where it felt less like inspiration/motivation and more like scare-tactics were used to get people to do their work. The assessments carry so much weight that a few of my classmates failed because they freaked out during the test and couldn't recover. The instructors tell you to "make sure you sleep", "take care of yourself", etc. But then there's a timed assessment that basically dictates your future looming over your head. And every day is regimented, scheduled, lectured and pre-determined for you, that there isn't time to catch up from anything in the previous days.This all may sound scary, and intimidating or more like a military boot camp, than a coding one (I sometimes wonder if that's really what they're going for), but after the assessments are done, and the weight of dismissal has been lifted, things start to make sense. Around Week 7/8 is when you start to build your fullstack project. For me at least, this is where all the pieces began to come together. Each of the topics that we learned finally had a place, and while you still don't know everything about any of it all, you have at least a base understanding that you can build from. You can start to ask questions about where to begin, where to go, what you want to do, etc.To be clear, the level of knowledge that you gain once the first 9 weeks are done WILL allow you to build a fullstack, fully working app. Will it be the next Facebook, Google, Instagram or Snapchat? Highly unlikely, but you now have a solid foundation that could possibly get you there.All in all, my outlook on the program is that I didn't much care for certain portions of it while going through it, but I am thankful for being shown the frustrations, intricacies and the BS that comes with web development. As they say, "what doesn't dismiss you from bootcamp, only makes you a stronger software dev" (or something like that ;-) ).So to conclude, this school isn't for everyone, it doesn't need to be. If you thrive in pressure or at least know yourself well enough to be able to work through intense situations, then this may be for you. Just know that it's not going to be pretty. It's not going to be easy. But if you make it through, you should feel rewarded.DISCLAIMER: I'm currently in the job search portion of the curriculum, so I cannot fully give an opinion on this piece yet.

One of my favorite moments at a/A is when I completed my full-stack project with all the skills I learned from the program. That kind of satisfaction cannot be expressed in words. If you are also thinking of becoming a software engineer, I would highly recommend you to apply to a/A because there is no better place than this bootcamp.Read Less",app-academy

In order to do that I needed to have a deeper understanding than putting code together. Ask anyone that works for a big tech company or what makes the difference between a good programmer and a great one. They will all tell you they understand how things work more.One of the criticisms I hear is that App Academy has a good portion of their curriculum using Ruby. I understand it is not as popular of a language as JavaScript and Python but the part I like is how they use the language to teach concepts of computer science that are extremely useful going into a big company or building your own. Think of it this way, they trade you getting deep knowledge of software engineering for the trade off of learning a popular language. Having worked with 3 other languages and familiar with about 10, Ruby is a really really easy language to learn and why struggle with a language when you can struggle and grow with concepts and understanding of software engineering as a whole.Take my advice, if you're looking for a web development bootcamp, take App Academy.

This is the main advantage of the bootcamp opposed to trying to learn the material on your own. The curriculum is good in this sense, but don't expect to learn everything or even cover everything that a junior developer should know. The curriculum is intensive, but introductory. Think of the curriculum as a spring-board for learning more on your own outside of working hours and after the conclusion of the program. The TAs / instructors are also what make the program worth it. They are invested in helping you and making sure that you understand the material. That being said, you must study, or you will fall behind and get kicked out. This means putting in a lot of hours and letting the curriculum consume you. Even then, you must study hard &amp; study smart. Long hours of work doesn't guarantee mastery, so learn how to study before you show up.The people you work with will be awesome. Your peers are usually quite driven and all on the same career path as you. This being said, you will have to learn how to work with different people with different personalities. Be the kind of person you would want to work with. Since the foundation of the first 7 weeks is pair-programming, this program is not for people that cannot interact well with others. The classroom environment is not the greatest. You sit on a crowded floor at long tables (full of mac minis) coding all day with a partner. The chairs are terrible and you will start to feel it if you don't get up often. The lecture hall consists of 50+ folding chairs that also feel terrible (especially after 3 hours of lecture). Don't fall for the nice looking banner pictures on the website that portray these hipsters drinking coffee in lounging couches while coding. That's not what this program is, that is just clever marketing. I highly suggest, that anyone interested in attending A/A come visit the work sites. It is not a deal breaker, but you should have an accurate view of the place you will be spending the next 3 months. Lastly, if your finances permit, don't take the deferred payment option. Be motivated, do well, and pay upfront. The huge caveat is that you need to do well and not get kicked out. If you have more questions about this, then just do the math between the two plans, and ask questions. Don't just blindly sign an agreement until you understand everything.Overall, I have been enjoying the program, however, I don't think that this program is for everyone.

You need to be willing to spend the time though; you should not have a terribly active social life or spend much time goofing off outside of class.

First, they say that they care about your ergonomic health, but this is not true in the slightest. They have no options for better keyboards or mice, no monitors at eye level, horrible chairs. This may get better in the future based on some of the conversations I had, but I wouldn't count on it. Cohorts are in and out of there in 9 weeks so there is little incentive to actually make the working conditions better. The other area of disappointment was the availability of the instructors.

Read More in landing that first software development role after graduating University (or High School?). For me, it was absolutely worth it.1. This is one of the only coding bootcamps which hold you to a certain learning-pace with weekly assessments for the first 8-ish weeks. If you fall behind and fail two of them, you're out of the program, and trust me this will take a lot of work to pass. It ensures that you actually learned the material and can do the basics, but the pace of this program isn't for everyone. You will wake up in the morning, get to the office, code all day, go home, work on HW assignments, code some more, sleep, then repeat for 3 months. You will literally live/eat/breathe code for the duration and you'll learn so much, but this brings up my second point.2. You will have no life during the program. When people say this in the reviews, they're not being excessive. I almost had a panic attack on the night before my first assessment (Sunday) because I was struggling with some concepts. You will learn a new concept and then be expected to pass an assessment on it the following week, while already learning new material. Tell your friends/girlfriend/family/dog that you'll pay attention to them after 3 months. (For reference, my cohort had like 20% of the cohort drop out... This isn't a joke)3. You will meet some of the most brilliant people you've ever met in your cohort. We've had Ivy-League grads, WallStreet guys, Entrepreneurs, Musicians, Basement gamers who want to finally get a job, etc... They were from all different backgrounds, but almost every single one of them were brilliant in their own way. I actually felt dumb for the first time in my life. Being surrounded by these people and pair-programming with each of them every single day will help you learn and see code in a different way. You'll also learn how to deal with not-so-favorable people, which will help you during your actual job (stubborn/argumentative people, keyboard hogs, etc), but these interactions are rare.4. The Job-Search support is actually one of the best parts of this curriculum. Technical and Non-Technical interviewing is a skill just like programming, and you'll gain a ton of practice white boarding and talking about yourself/background. My career coach was the best hype-man I could've ever asked for, and I think he actually helped me ultimately land my first role.If you put in the work, and you pass all the assessments, you'll land a job. A vast majority of my cohort all landed jobs within the first 6-months after program completion.The most important part is putting in the work after you actually finish the program (Job-Search is honestly the hardest part because there's minimal hand holding and you're actually competing for roles against other people who often have CS degrees). There's no time for an extended break after completing the program. Start working on more features on your fullstack project, start learning data structures / algorithms more in depth, white board at least once a week, etc... It will take a lot of work. The best part is that you have access to the office at all times, so you can go in to work while you look for a job even after you complete the program.For me, this program changed my life and I'm thankful I went through it.Lastly, I want to share one tip: Before you start the program, you absolutely should complete a beginner's web-development "course" on freecodecamp or Udemy.

Read More try to stay in contact with, we bonded deeply through the trials that we went through. This was one of the best benefits of the program- I am now employed as a software engineer and I am making double what I was earning before, living where I want to live, working for a cause I care about- I feel like I have a skill that makes me marketable and valuable, that gives me a greater sense of independence from the employer I will work for- I gained confidence in my ability to learn a complex skill fast- I can type 75 wpm, despite starting the cohort at 35ish - My interview skills were far better than I expected after the program, I think the pressure of the assessments makes technical interview pressure pale in comparison- I built a full-stack web app, mostly on my own that looked awesome on my portfolio- I was able to get a job after only two months of applying after the cohort ended- Lot's of people in my cohort got jobs at a/A after which helped them- Strong emphasis on CSS which is boring at first but ends up being very importantCons: - Serious lack of CS teaching- I was horrified and unsure of whether or not I would make it through the program until I passed assessment 5- I had to live in a place I hate to attend the program- The assessments are scary and sometimes are significantly harder than the practice assessments, so you don't know what to expect- Most TA's solidly taught and understood the material for our cohort, but often times the TA's are teaching you the just after completing a cohort, so they don't have mastery over it. I wish they had more experienced TA's with CS backgrounds who deeply understood the material- Some people were far worse than others in the cohort an they sucked up lots of the instruction time, I felt TA's could have done a better job of prioritizing assistance- They teach Ruby (which is a dying language) and JS, when they really should be teaching Python and JS- Career coaches can come off as job application enforcers, and mine didn't help me get my foot in any door, he just tried to give me advice which was occasionally helpful- 5/10k is a lot of money to lose if you fail the cohort, that's takes a real mental toll to try to study when you have that much money on the line- Working 90-100 hours a week for 2.5 months was emotionally draining and I usually could only take 2 hours or so off per weekAdditional Thoughts:After searching for jobs for 2 months, I realized that Python would have been far better to learn than Ruby. Everyone uses it basically. Other bootcamps probably teach Python and JS and that might make the job search easier. I like Ruby, but I find it hard to recommend the program because of the decision to teach Ruby and not Python. The cost is fairly high, and so it is hard to enroll in a/A without some money in the bank. It ends up being a sort of accelerator for already privileged people, which is not what they necessarily advertise. This is just how it is unfortunately. Also the advertisements are inaccurate because most people don't get jobs at Google unless they were TA's at a/A for some time. Another thing is that a/A is somewhat of a revolving door, I am noticing that the best instructors leave almost as soon as they become fully capable instructors. This might lead to lower quality instruction. a/A doesn't have good organization as a company and people working for them complain about things like not getting paid and constant misunderstandings. I would never go through something like this again, but I can't deny that it worked for me and most of my cohort. About 50% of us landed jobs, and fast. However, a few of the other 50% of students were able to get through but some of them mysteriously seem like they still don't understand coding, and were able to get through by just memorizing practice assessments. I think this set of people is might struggle for a long time and maybe give up. The weeding out is not as intense as it should be. a/A was scary and intense but it imposes immense focus on you that allows you to surpass your previous ignorance and gain serious skills that make you employable, and eventually well paid. I turned my whole life around in just 9 months (I studied a lot before the program). I have a love hate relationship with it but more love than hate overall. My life has become drastically better and I feel empowered now in a way I never felt before.Read Less",app-academy

On day 1, the head instructor made a joke that we should tell our friends and family that we're going on a 12 week cruise. He was joking, but at the same time... he wasn't. My personal experience of the workload at App Academy was get to class around 7//7:30am to finish up whatever homework I didn't complete the night before, 9am-6pm class time. 6pm -8:30//9pm homework and then rinse and repeat for Mon-Fri. Generally I would take Friday night off to give myself a mental break, but Saturday and Sunday you could find myself and most of the App Academy Students in the classroom Studying for the Assessments. TLDR: This class is no joke. You cannot have a social life and succeed in this bootcamp. (At the very least don't expect to unless, you may be able to get a night out here and there if somehow you're ahead on the material)Assessments:Yes this is one of the few BootCamps that relies on Assessments. Yes they are very stressful. Yes there is a lot of practice work given to help you pass these assessments. Yes they are hard. HOWEVER, I couldn't be happier that we had these assessments. At the end of the day, you can sit through the lectures, you can do the homeworks and finish the in class assignments, but practicing and studying for these assessments is what really drills the information into your brain. Keep in mind though, you can be removed from the program if you fail two assessments. This can make the program a lot more stressful for people who are either not good test takers or do not put the work in. These assessments are not made to trick you, but made to make sure you know the minimum amount of knowledge to continue with the program. Without that minimum knowledge, you will not succeed with the rest of the program.TLDR: Assessments are hard, but not if you keep up with the work and study on weekends. Bad test takers, bewareInstructors:The instructors are absolutely awesome. All instructors are extremely knowledgeable in the topics being taught, and clearly have extensive experience in teaching the material. They're all also extremely helpfulCulture:The Culture at a/A is extremely welcoming, and I can tell that I will remain friends with many of my cohort-mates for many years to come. We've spent many many hours in class together and even more on slack.Worth it?100%. We are just starting the job application process now, but from everyone I've talked to who is in a place to hire Software Developers, App Academy consistently trains the strongest job candidates from all the other BootCamps in NYC. No matter your background or previous experience in coding, you can succeed in this class with the right amount of work. I personally did not have any coding experience and am currently feeling super confident going into the job search process. TLDR of the entire review - If you've already made the decision to take up a bootcamp, willing to sacrifice 12 weeks of your social life, and wand the best bang for your buck, App Academy is the choice.Read Less",app-academy

Teaching competency of instructors varies – some are excellent, some are mediocre – but honestly it's probably as good as you can expect from any coding bootcamp. Instructor support overall is very good. Everything you need for a solid foundation to begin the cohort is provided throughout the application process; what's key is setting aside enough time to properly absorb the material (at least two months prior to interviewing, a month between the first and last interview, and a month between admission and cohort start time). The provided prep material is time intensive in its own right, and most who struggle to keep up didn't spend enough time preparing. Time to catch up after beginning the cohort is almost non-existent. What makes aA stand out: - Rigid structure of accountability through roll calls, assignments, and assessments. Like having a good physical trainer, you may often hate the diet and the workouts in the moment, but in the long run you'll be surprised how much you progress.  - Constant pair programming and collaborative work. Especially taxing for introverts, but enormously helpful in learning how to communicate effectively. A significant advantage over solo/remote study options, and even most university curricula. - Outstanding job search curriculum. Lots of very helpful workshops, application prep, and interview practice. Can you learn everything taught in a bootcamp on your own? Almost certainly. What you're paying for is the opportunity to learn it faster, make connections with other students/instructors, and receive solid career coaching.

You are required to check in 3 times a day... Read More (9AM, 1:30PM, and 4:00PM) or you will get a strike. 10 strikes and you're out. Overall, you will learn Ruby, SQL, Rails, JavaScript, React, and Redux. You won't get much practice on HTML/CSS, until you get to your full stacks in week 8, where you put everything together to clone a website. For the first 7 weeks, the daily routine is basically HTML/CSS in the morning, lecture until about lunch time, then pair programming the rest of the day. The last 30 minutes are spent with your "circle" discussing your day. The evenings are spent on reading and watching videos on tomorrow's material and usually accompanied with basic exercises. The readings and videos will take a decent chunk of your time, so I suggest doing them ahead of time if you can. There are 6 assessments throughout the course. They tell you almost exactly what is going to be on the assessment, they give you a practice assessment, they give you a test generator to time yourself, they give you a video of a TA going through the practice assessment. Basically you shouldn't feel lost when studying up for the assessment. All the resources are there for you. When full stacks arrive on week 8, things change. No more lectures, no more circle time, and no more readings and videos. You work on your full stack all day, helping each other out when you hit bugs, giving tips to others who are doing the same or similar websites.Some constructive criticism. The lectures, especially toward the end of the curriculum, were particularly long, and most of it was very similar to our homework that we already completed the previous night. I honestly only found those lectures useful for asking questions, but I did not feel the need to spend 2-3 more hours on the same topic we already spent hours learning for homework. The instructions for the daily projects are outstanding, providing step-by-step instructions on what you need to do next and why, that is up until around the end of week 6. Often times there will be a bulleted-list of directions telling you to implement so-and-so, when before these bulleted-list of directions would each have their own paragraph, supplemented with code snippets and explanations. In the React projects especially, they would tell you to implement something, and a few lines later, they'd provide the exact code you should write. I don't think that is helpful to our understanding. Some TAs are older and more experienced, others are recent graduates of App Academy themselves. Some are clearly better at explaining, while some kind of just look at the solutions and tell you to write what the solutions did. I'm thankful they are all trying and willing to help, but I'd always hope for certain TAs over others when hitting that "Ask a question" button.All in all, it was a very rewarding experience. I've met and made many new friends. Knowing that everyone else in your cohort is going through the exact same thing is reassuring, that everyone else is sleep-deprived and feeling exhausted all the time, that if you ran into a bug that someone else will most likely have also ran into the same bug, that you have others who also committed the next 9 weeks to change their life. I've learned more at App Academy and produced more projects that I am proud of than I did in 4 years in college as a Computer Science major. If you are thinking about attending App Academy, I'd definitely recommend it. Be prepared to make some great friends, and also be prepared for some feels when your new friends drop out.

Read More through interviewing and accepted a job as a software engineer (have been working for 1 month now). I think very favorably of the program overall, but want to provide some quick bullets to answer questions that I know I had when considering if App Academy was right for me:1. How long does it take to get a job after finishing the program? - I feel very fortunate in that I was connected with a company with an App Academy alum at my graduation night (the final week of the program) and wrapped up my interview cycle with them in 2 weeks. This is not the norm, though. Expect your search on average to take anywhere from 4-9 months.2. What is the average starting salary? - My offer was just shy of $100k at a company in New York City. Friends of mine from App Academy who have gotten jobs in the past few weeks have all been offered slightly more than me, but I hear the average range is closer to $85-90k for App Academy graduates in the New York area.3. What are the payment plan options? - There are 3 choices: (1 - upfront) $17k all up front, (2 - hybrid) $9k up front and $14k in scheduled payments after accepting a job, and (3 - deferred) $5k upfront and $23k in payments after accepting a job. For #s 2 and 3, how you pay off the larger second amount depends on your starting salary; if you sign the alumni engagement agreement (you agree to mentor future students and show up at a/A events), your tuition will be capped at either 23% (hybrid) or 28% (deferred) of your starting salary and you'll pay the lower of that amount or the written amount that you owe. For example, if you accept a starting salary of $85k and you have chosen the hybrid plan, you'd only have to pay $10.55k back instead of the full $14k. Your payment schedule depends on your starting salary as well, but expect to pay between $1500 and $2000 monthly until you've paid back what you owe. If you don't accept a job after a year from when the program ends and you've been looking with a good faith effort, you get your money back. 4. Does App Academy force me to take the first job I get? - No. You can choose to turn down offers that don't make sense for you, but I'm pretty sure if you do that and don't accept a job by the time the year after your program ends, you're still on the hook for tuition since you technically did get a job offer.5. Will I feel prepared to join the workforce as a software engineer when the program is up?- Imposter syndrome will tell you no, and that's not totally wrong. There is still so much that I want to learn about software development where I feel like I'm currently just scratching the surface. But, I do feel qualified for my current job. App Academy did a great job of teaching me both the fundamentals and how to learn things quickly that I don't know (Google is your friend! All developers, bootcamp or not, use it daily!). There's been nothing I've encountered at my job so far that I've had no idea how to handle.6. Who are the instructors?- The instructors are former App Academy students that most times are hired while they are still students, so they know the material very well but have not yet worked as developers outside of App Academy. The curriculum is developed by lead TAs who take the job very seriously and travel to conferences/attend meetups to make sure it is up-to-date and relevant.7. Who will my classmates be?- Students seem to vary in their backgrounds. Expect a cohort in NYC to be around 40 people though, and maybe 5 of them will have a CS degree. Closer to 1/3 might have previous light coding experience (SQL, basic JavaScript) from another job. 8. What languages will I learn and are they useful in the job market?- App Academy will teach you Ruby, JavaScript, SQL, HTML and CSS as languages. More specifically, you'll learn Rails as a backend framework and React/Redux as frontend libraries to help you render web pages. Ruby is not used heavily anymore but is a great semantic starter language to help teach you how to code. React, from what I've seen, is where job demand is right now. My current team uses React.9. Is it really possible to be successful in this program with no coding background?- Yes. I had no coding background. That being said though, it takes a lot of work and determination to get up to speed. I did the JumpStart program through a/A which taught me coding basics for free after work over 4 weeks. Then once I was accepted, I meticulously when through the pre-cohort prep course (alpha course) before beginning classes. Take alpha seriously and make sure you understand it thoroughly; there's office hours for your questions.10. Cons?- It's a stressful environment where you can fail out if you don't pass 2 of the weekly exams. There are only 6 exams total so they don't last for your whole time in the program, but they are very high stress and require a strong ability to focus and mitigate any anxiety that this may induce for you. The prep resources are there to help you (there are always practice exams for you to take and TAs will occasionally have test walk-throughs to attend before the assessments) but you need to put the work in to succeed. My one complaint about App Academy is there is still room for improvement for how TA's provide emotional support to students who do not handle stress well. If that is you, you can still do this program - don't be discouraged! But you will have to go out of your way to ask for emotional support and feedback from your TAs and peers.Read Less",app-academy

I recommend going out of your way to look up your own documentation of the concepts introduced in the Alpha Course Curriculum. Chris Pine’s Intro to Ruby free online course helped me a lot in that regard, you can google it but I believe App Academy should have also linked you to that resource. The program is intense, even for people with cs degrees. People with background will definitely catch up concepts faster and some will be a review for them. But it doesn't mean its not hard for them. As a someone without tech background, came to aA everyday including weekends to study. They are not lying about 100 hours per week of studing time. for the first 9 weeks, I've never slept more than 6 hours.

We've learned Ruby, SQL, Javascript, React, Redux,... Read More Rails, and completed a full-stack clone of an existing application. There are people of all ages and backgrounds here. The youngest being 17 (by a pretty wide margin), and the oldest 40+. There are quite a few CS majors, but also people with engineering, accounting, sales, etc. backgrounds. However, the gender ratio for this cohort was pretty bad: about 1/12 are female. There are definitely people who are a lot better at coding from the start than others, which may change over the course of the program, so be prepared for that.In my opinion, these are the two most incredible parts of a/A:1. How much you learn, and how fast you learn it. The workload is intense (see below), but you'll amaze yourself with how capable you are of absorbing it! 2. The people. The TA's are very intelligent and genuinely want to help you succeed. The culture is not competitive at all. Everyone supports each other. We help one another with bugs, explain concepts to those who are struggling, get lunch together, and generally have a good time while coding. This community is actually very important, especially considering that we spend at least 45 hours together/week.When you apply and pass the interviewing process, you must complete an Alpha Course — essentially a pretty packed curriculum on the basics of Ruby and Object Oriented Programming. a/A recommends that you spend 4 weeks on this, which is definitely a good idea. However, completely it in less than that time is doable if you can fully commit all your time to doing it. I finished in less than 2 weeks, although I had some prior programming experience in Java. I also spent nearly the entirety of every day working on it. Each day during the first section of the actual course looked pretty much the same, save the material we learned that day: 9am start, lecture for around 2 hours, then pair program for the rest of the day to practice the material taught in lecture, with a break for lunch and a brief one in the afternoon. After the school day is over, we do 1-3 hours of homework. The homework consists of readings/videos and a small assignment that cover the material for the next day, which will be reviewed during the lecture. This is why a/A is definitely a full-time commitment — really try to keep up, and this is totally doable if you are sufficiently motivated and allocate your time wisely. At first, it was pretty difficult to adjust to this schedule: my eyes would be really sore by Thursday of each week for the first 3 weeks, and there are no windows so it's a little stifling. However, by the end of that, I was fully adapted.There are a total of 6 assessments spread across the first 8 weeks, and if you fail twice, and then fail a retake, you are kicked out, no exceptions. This is a really strict policy, and it's definitely a lot of pressure. About 25% of the people in my cohort were kicked out, so please consider this carefully. I failed the third assessment, and was really stressed for the rest, but passed them without a problem. These assessments really are not designed to get you or anything like that. They provide practice assessments, and as long as you do those until you can finish it in about half the time you get for the real assessment, you will be totally fine. Just make sure you understand the material — don't simply memorize! Overall, an amazing experience, and I would definitely do it again given the choice.Read Less",app-academy

I'll just talk about the experience I have to this point. The way the curriculum works is that you have 9 weeks of the learning curriculum. You learn Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, React,... Read More Redux, SQL, and more. You also create your full-stack project.The next 3 weeks is the career curriculum. Here they teach you what you need to do to get a job, and what you should expect. During this time, you create a javascript project.First off let me say, it is a difficult program. When they say 100 hours/week, it's literally 100 hours per week. It is a pretty hard thing to get used to. Also, during the first 9 weeks, there are 6 assessments that you have to pass. If you don't pass 2, your out. So kind of harsh. However, at the end of it, it's a really accomplished feeling.I would recommend planning on not having a life for the 3 months you are in the program.

And then you grow up to realize they're pretty much winging it? Elements of App Academy feel a bit like that.To be clear, I really enjoyed App Academy... Read More and thought it was about as good as one could do trying to teach this amount of material in a very condensed period of time. But I don't think aA should remain complacent because there is definitely room for improvement. For instance, when you first arrive, you learn a bit about the TAs, some of whom may have just graduated from aA the week before. This isn't inherently a bad thing, but you do see a big disparity between TAs who have more experience and those that are hot off the presses for lack of a better term. This becomes more obvious the more you ask about topics that are tangentially related to the curriculum. I think the TAs on average tend to nail topics related to every day's projects, but if you're looking for a resource to widen your understanding of some technologies you may find yourself slightly disappointed depending on who you ask. The next element I took issue with is the check-in structure. I want to emphasize this: bootcamp students are adult humans. App Academy has a thrice daily check-in (by 9, 1:10-1:130, 3:55-4:00) that must be done on their internet to confirm that you're there. On one hand--I get it because we do pair programming for most of the day and missing out on the pairing screws over your partner for the day. On the other hand, we don't need to be treated like elementary school students and should be given at least a LITTLE more license over our education. This isn't likely to change anytime soon, so if it seems overbearing to you, keep that in mind.Assessments. The assessments are necessary but flawed... one one hand, you need to make sure students are really keeping up with their understanding of the material because if you don't understand each week or day's subject matter, you're setting yourself up for failure in the coming weeks. That said, the assessments aren't so dynamic that you can't just read the specs, learn the patterns, and pass the assessments without fundamentally understanding the core concepts. All this is to say that students that don't have a great understanding of the material can sneak through the system by memorizing patterns needed for assessments. I think they could stand to be recalibrated.The curriculum is excellent but the project instructions vary pretty drastically from day to day. Some days the projects feel clear as day and the instructions step through the material in a way that puts you and your partner in the driver's seat giving you the appropriate amount of hints/code. Other days the instructions feel really really open ended and make far too many assumptions about our prior knowledge. I could continue to nitpick details about App Academy, but at the end of the day, the students are bright, motivated, and the environment is extremely positive and supportive. While the work load at times can feel overwhelming, the TAs and your fellow students are always there to help. I would recommend App Academy to just about anybody looking to quickly get from 0 to 100 as a web developer and I would encourage aA to never stop improving.Read Less",app-academy

The best example (and my favorite aspect of the program as a whole) are the TAs and instructional staff. These are mainly past graduates who have decided to help new students find their way through the intense 9 week curriculum. Because they have been through the program themselves they know what the students are going through, and do an amazing job of providing support when needed - be it technical help on a tough coding problem, or providing some much needed reassurance when the grind becomes real - they really do care and will spend hours (literally) with you until you understand a concept comfortably.Speaking of the grind, App Academy will test you. But that’s what a bootcamp is meant to do. Sleepless nights, hours of homework reading and problems (after 9 hours of coding), and weekly assessments will push you to your mental and physical limits. You will experience moments where the last thing you want to do is write another line of code, or spend another hour trying to debug your program. The most important thing is to keep on trying, and ask for help when you need it. The support system is there for you to take advantage of, and everyone is happy to help.But it’s not all bad. In fact, there is so much more that is good about this bootcamp. For as much stress and frustration you will go through, you will experience twice the amount of achievement, learning, and moments of triumph. You will learn to build so many cool things and come away with the confidence to continue learning on your own afterward. You will build new and deep friendships with classmates going through the same struggle and grind. The alumni community at App Academy is healthy, growing, and super friendly.

AppAcademy provided me structure and forced me to be disciplined and I was able to make massive progress in 3 months, much more than I ever did when I was self-studying and not fully immersing myself.I would say that most of the knowledge is picked up through pair programming. Having to work with another partner daily during the curriculum really sharpened my understanding of not only the material but my ability to articulate it to other people. You'll also learn a lot when you help your cohort mates debug and vice versa. The curriculum is very fast-paced and it is amazing how fast you feel that you can fall behind in only a day.

Needless to say, I am looking forward to opening up this new chapter in my career.To answer some questions that I had when I was making the decision to enroll:- The language you learn doesn't matter. Once you are familiar with how web-development works, you realize that there are similar patterns/conventions that are fundamental to each language. Different programming languages can all achieve the same means.- Make sure you enroll ahead of the months notice that they tell you to. You do have pre-curriculum prep that you have to do before the cohort that requires at least two weeks of time. I personally went through the prep work twice before my cohort started as well as learning as much JavaScript as I could. This goes a long way between determining how stressed you feel during the lecture part of the curriculum when you're learning new materials everyday.- I did a good amount of problems on CodeWars and CodeFights and LeetCode during my preparation for the application. While it helped me learn how to problem solve, web development is actually a totally different beast!

That helped me to understand concepts of programming while preparing for coding challenge and later in the program. This doesn't mean you have to spend two years, but few months of intense learning will help a lot, and I would also strongly recommend to take Ruby course on Codecademy or similar website. Second thing, if you get accepted to JumpStart, don't just do homework problems and think this is enough. This is huge mistake. You should do a t least three times more than homework. Many people that relied only on homework failed to pass JumpStart assessments. Third thing, WORK HARD. The curriculum in A/a is designed the way that you WILL NOT have free weekend. Every weekend you will have stuff to work on. It's very easy to fall behind. Overall the school is great and gives you practical knowledge to be a junior dev. Course also covers general CS concepts like data structures and teaches you algorithms towards the end of the course. Every day you are required to leave you feedback about instructors, and they read those reviews and take steps to improve program.Read Less",app-academy

Prior to this class the only coding experience I had was from an Intro to Programming college class 6 years ago.COURSE PACE / MATERIALCompared to a 3 month... Read More Introductory to Programming class offered at a college, this is a one month course. But you’ll learn more in the one month than an entire semester in a traditional college setting. The class meets for two and a half hours a day, five days a week for four weeks. Expect to start the first day with a two and half hour lecture. Overall the course was very well paced and clearly delivers coding foundations and basics. I made the mistake of falling behind which led the first two weeks being very challenging. Assignments are given out every day so prepare to spend extra time outside of class (1 to 2hrs/day) coding and learning. Lesson notes are provided as text as well as video walk through which was VERY helpful. You can also ask the instructors for help if needed, they were always available after class. As far as learning enough to get accepted into a top bootcamp: the class offers a money back guaranteed so you really can’t lose out. I do feel that graduated who spend time practicing after the course will have a very good shot at making it into top bootcamps. INSTRUCTORS / NON-TECHNICAL BENEFITSThis was what made the class worth it for me. Usually when you talk to someone (especially an instructor that works for a bootcamp) you’ll notice they’re trying to sell you something. That wasn’t the case here. I had a TON of questions about working in coding, surviving the 100hour/week main bootcamp, what the job market was like for graduates of a full time bootcamp, what can cause someone to fail, etc.. The Bootcamp Prep instructors (Alvin and David) were very honest and accommodating.For the first time I felt like I was getting real and genuine answers. Alvin and David were very patient and didn’t sugar coat anything. The info they gave really helped solidify my desire to go into software engineering and allowed me to plan and prepare accordingly to attend a full time bootcamp in the future.

Read More Seems extremely harsh, and the babies don't know what to do at first, but they quickly figure it out because they have to.My background: I had a little programming experience coming in - I built an app and put it on the Play Store, among other small projects. That being said, it too me 5 attempts, using Ruby, to get in. APPLICATION PROCESSThere was 1 small coding challenge, then 1 remote interview via Skype (which I had two chances at), which I didn't pass, so I was referred to a "JumpStart" program to help me get up to speed, roughly 3 hours per night during the week at App Academy. Again, 2 chances to pass part 1 (which I already had) or part 2. I didn't pass either of them, although it was close. Then I was told there was one more opportunity at a remote technical interview via Skype, which I jumped at, and finally passed. Then, one more non-technical "fit" interview which was just like a normal job interview, and then I was in.ONCE YOU'RE INThere is a lot of front loaded information before you even start your first day. It's called the "Alpha Curriculum." It goes over Ruby basics, helps you get your machine environment setup, and you build little projects to prepare you. Near the end you build something like Battleship and I think it runs in the terminal. Takes about 100 total hours to complete the Alpha Curriculum.DAY TO DAY EXPERIENCEFor the first 8 weeks, you're paired with someone to program with. All day, every day. You switch "driving" and "navigating" roles every 15 minutes. One of you is meant to guide the direction of the code, and the other to implement it. There is a strike system in place meant to keep you present and on task, 10 strikes and you're dismissed from App Academy. There are also 6 assessments that you need to pass. If you fail twice, you're also dismissed (you get a single retry on your second fail). It seems harsh, but the content you learn builds heavily on previous content.How a normal week day looks:1-3 hours of lecture5-7 hours of pair programming1 hour lunch2-4 hours of homework (consisting of reading, videos - shorter if you watch on 2x speed, coding exercises)How a weekend looks:12-20 hours of preparation for assessments. Usually a sample assessment is released, which you are expected to grind over during the weekend, in addition to 2-3 hours of homework for Monday.WHAT YOU LEARNBasically you're learning web technologies. Ruby and Rails for the backend, JavaScript, React, and Redux for the frontend. After 8 weeks of pair programming is complete, you start your first stack project, and complete it in 10 days. For example, this was mine: https://infinotes.herokuapp.com/After the full stack project, there is a JavaScript project, and lastly a "flex" project that you're expected to complete with a team. These last two projects take place during the job search portion of the course, when you work on resumes, interview skills, and algorithms.If web technologies if what you're looking for, and I'm told that it translates well to other fields, then you'll definitely learn it here.There are no days off, no breathers between projects.Read Less",app-academy

My instructor emailed me consistently, and even helped me through the initial phases of just knowing where to type.Instructor : Coding people have a (IMO deserved) reputation of not being the best communicators. This was what scared me most about transitioning my career. I did not want to be at the mercy of someone who is crass and can't communicate with people. The instructor, Alvin, and his TA, David, were by far the best people anyone could ask for when it came to teaching the class. Alvin responds to emails usually in less than one hour (if I message him on Slack, far quicker of course), and the way he teaches, there is no way someone can fall behind. Each line of code is explained in bitter detail until everyone has a positive look on their face.Material : VIDEO WALKTHROUGHS. for every single problem on the homework or assessment, Alvin made videos walking through each one. I now have access to those walkthroughs for life on Github. If you are new to coding, these walkthroughs are your lifeblood. You can easily learn everything you need to know without stepping foot in a classroom if you have a good walkthrough for a problem set. These walkthroughs are thorough, and I used them for interview prep extensively. Competition: I was lucky(un-lucky) enough to have some extra cash to spend to seal the deal on nailing the technical interviews. I decided to enroll in Hack Reactor's prep course. I chose the premium prep option in which I was given a mentor who would design a curriculum based on my level of knowledge. I really just wanted technical interview questions so I could review them with my mentor. When I signed up, I knew fairly quickly this wasn't going to be App Academy. In order to get answers to questions as a premium prepper, I had to submit it in a certain format on a certain site, etc. When you have a question to a problem, the last thing you want is to have to go through the process of submitting it for review (and waiting 24-48 hours). The course itself was actually free, so i actually only paid for the submission of the code.My mentor, who was already uncomfortable with me just wanting to do the technical interview prep, wanted me initially to start off at ground 0 learning what a variable was. After a prickly conversation, I moved on to a video session with him. Very knowledgeable guy, I just probably wouldn't put him as the mentor to receive people at first. I asked for a refund, and received one very quickly from the very nice people there. I think Hack Reactor is a strong tiered school, but their bootcamp prep approach differs from App Academy. I can promise you, as a ground 0 student, pay the extra money and go to a/A. This is not the only experience. My business partner left his job at the same time as I did, and enrolled in Galvanize Bootcamp Prep. Galvanize has a course in which they don't even give you solutions to problems! He quickly had to leave because there were no problem reviews, and the instructor had never done the problems himself. I kid you not, he refused to answer how to do an isEven function, and instead said to "think about how to do it". You will never pass a technical interview with not repeatedly doing problems.Conclusion : I can't speak to full bootcamps, the other camps I mentioned have extremely strong track records of success at their full camps, and I would be lucky to get into their immersive programs. That being said, no one has put more effort into their prep than Bootcamp Prep at a/A. If you go to their course and do the work, you will be ahead of the curve come interview time.

While the course itself only takes 3 months, it is unlikely that you will find a job immediately after graduating. Many students take up to 3 months after AA to find a job, and some take as long as 6. You sign an agreement saying you won't take on any full-time employment during that time, so make sure you are financially stable enough to commit completely to finding an engineering position.3.

Some tips for future students:- About your peers: Most of my classmates have some coding background or self-studied some languages, while others didn't code before attending aA. There are CS graduates, and people with non-tech background. It is a diverse group, but one thing is in common: everyone is pretty passionate about coding and wants to make it. - About prior experience: Some people have asked me if they can attend without coding experience. In my opinion, having prior experience or not is not the deciding factor. The most important thing is making sure that you really want this. People have different learning styles, so think about whether you like a fast-paced environment.- That being said, do consider the potential risk of being dismissed after two failures in assessments. We have 6 assessments in total. In our cohort and previous cohort, the dismiss rate is about 20%. - If you can, try to learn data structures and algorithms before you start aA. In aA, recursion is taught in one day. It is helpful to know basics such as Big O time complexity, sorting algorithms, etc. before you start this program. Two of the assessments are about algorithms (in Ruby and JavaScript).- I also hope I had known more CSS before I came in. CSS is relatively easy to learn on one's own, but there are so many details. In aA we don't learn a lot about CSS in the curriculum, just because it is not the focus of the curriculum. Core curriculum includes Ruby, Rails, SQL, JavaScript, React/Redux. But you do need to write HTML/CSS in your final projects.- Pair programming: At first I was skeptical, but it turned out to be the best thing about aA. I learned so much from my coding pairs.The job search curriculum starts next week. So I don't know yet.Personal story: I considered switching my career path to coding in 2013. But I thought it's impossible with my liberal arts background. So I didn't give it too much thought and pursued another path. But inevitably I came back to coding. I started to code more in 2016 but still hesitated about whether to apply for developer jobs. When I finally made up my mind it was kind of late. But better late than never... I am grateful for being able to make that decision. No matter the results, had to try. I think you don't have to attend a bootcamp. Just don't give up easily. Try to learn programming for several months and see if you enjoy it. If not, that's fine. Even if you really want to be in the tech industry, there are options: many other roles like marketing/design are fun rewarding jobs too.Read Less",app-academy

A roadmap advice for fellow future developers applying to App Academy: one, study up. The bootcamp says they will accept students even if they have not never code before. However, the coding challenges to get accepted in the bootcamp are not trivial. They will require some basic knowledge of a programming language. App Academy also offers a free JumpStart program or a Bootcamp Prep course that will prepare you for these coding challenges. If you have never coded before, I highly advise doing either of the programs I mentioned before. They are extremely helpful and you also get a taste of the App Academy's culture before joining. Great! You passed the coding challenges and the non-technical interview and are accepted into App Academy. Now what? It is very important to do and complete the Alpha Course before the start of the curriculum. Ninja advice, the Alpha Course will prep you well for the first two weeks, but you have to keep learning at a fast pace. You will not be doing just Ruby (the first language taught in App Academy) . If you have extra time before starting App Academy, my advice is to read up and look at some code for SQL and Ruby on Rails. This will smooth your transition from simple object oriented programming in the first two weeks to the first real web development process, backend development and database management. You are about to make an exciting decision in your life. Prepare for 80 to 90 hours a week of hard work. You will be living and breathing code.

So beyond the normal stress that this amount of work induces, there's not really much or any time to take care of yourself by going the gym, hanging out with friends, sleeping, etc.Time Management: Even though the first 9 weeks of this course are highly structured, you will still need to manage your own time well. This includes giving yourself enough time to sleep, even if your'e not finished with all of the work due the following day. Weeks 7 &amp; 8 comprise a self directed project, and weeks 9 - 12 have very little structure at all. How much you get out of those last 5 weeks, and the amount of time it takes you to get job offers once the program ends all depend on your ability to manage your time well.Cost: aA now has several payment plans, some of which allow students to defer the bulk of tuition payment until they are employed as software developers. That said, the average job search takes between 3 and 6 months, during which those students are contractually restricted from part-time work. This means you will need to be able to afford food and housing, while not working for at least 6 months (the course + minimum job search). In New York. So even if this program was free, a large cost barrier still exists.Culture: Even though there's not a lot of time to socialize, the cohorts do tend to get pretty tight, and you will need to to help each other out a lot (emotionally and academically). In my experience, there was a strong culture of collaboration, not competition, which I think is strengthened by the emphasis on pair programming at aA. Okay, that stuff out of the way, you will learn more than you thought possible in the course. The instruction is fantastic, both in lecture and one on one settings. The curriculum also teaches you how to approach learning technologies not covered, which will be an essential skill upon graduating. Even though you will likely have to put in a decent amount of work after graduation in order to land a job, you will be well prepared to do so by the course itself. If you do decide to attend, you can mitigate a lot of the negative stuff above by preparing well. Attend either JumpStart of Bootcamp Prep. Be really thorough when going through the alpha curriculum prior to the cohort start date. Reach out to people who have gone through the program and ask lots of questions.Good luck!Read Less",app-academy

Throughout the course I felt like I was barely keeping afloat during the material, as most everyone else was, as your TA's will tell you, this is normal. As we progressed through the course, I found myself understanding concepts later on through the week, and slowly found myself struggling with newer material at the tail end of the course. I started to feel not as strong as I did earlier on and worried that I would not be ready to tackle the fullstack project that is completed after the coding curriculum. That was completely not true, once we hit our projects I found out how much I learned and quickly was able to cover the knowledge gaps I did have beforehand just by working through the projects. Overall, I would say that attending this bootcamp can definitely be worth it if you feel as though you can put the time and work in.

In the weeks before my cohort started I read many of these reviews in search of clues that would help me know what to expect and how to succeed. Wondered... Read More if I would ever get the opportunity to write one. Promised myself that I would only contribute to the pile if I made it all the way through the final and ultimate challenge: getting a job.I start Monday, so here goes.App Academy is a fucking rollercoaster and during moments of frustration, satisfaction, hope, despair, pride, humility, fun, fatigue, laughter, and crying I often thought: “MY FINGER IS ON THE MEDIUM POST”. Okay, that was only for the bad times. For both the good and the bad the thought was: “this is going in the review”. I can’t recall all of what I intended to say during those moments now and a Knausgaard-esque stream-of-consciousness account of my App Academy experience is not what these review sites are for. So I will organize my thoughts into categories and bullet points for maximum skimability.GENERAL:- Yes, you do work the crazy hours they say you do. I generally went to bed around midnight and was up at 7 or 8AM. 85-95 hours a week is accurate.- No, they are not scared of kicking people out. My cohort lost like 20 or 25+%? It can be emotional losing people you befriended. It is depressing seeing people who worked hard have to leave. A lot of it can seem like chance. Anxiety, illness, fatigue, or just having a bad day can make the difference between a pass or a fail. Your best defense against any of these factors bringing you down is simply to study extremely hard for the tests.- Yes, there is a deposit they don’t tell you about. - No, App Academy is not a scam. GOOD:- The TAs. They are all intelligent, articulate, and helpful. You get assigned a TA as an advisor/mentor and mine was above-and-beyond supportive and awesome (shoutout to Anastassia).- The other students. App Academy attracts a smart bunch of people from all sorts of different backgrounds. Seriously, everyone is so smart. It’s easy to bond with people and make friends when you are all going through the same crazy experience.- The Ruby and Rails curriculum (first 4 weeks) is excellent.- For me the full-stack project was the highlight of App Academy. It’s rewarding to see everything you have learned come together to create something real. And it feels great to be able to make your own direction and have some creative freedom.- You learn React which is hot right now and a big asset when on the job search.- App Academy was my only option when it came to bootcamps for financial reasons. It sounds corny but it felt like someone believed in me and was willing to put money behind it. This was encouraging and motivating during the hard times.- Practicing interviewing during the job search helped my anxiety and performance during interviews.BAD:- The JavaScript curriculum is a dumpster fire. It's like a hastily-assembled Sunday night book report. Whoever made it seems to have Googled around for definitions of various JavaScript concepts then stitched them together into new documents so App Academy could say it had its OWN JavaScript curriculum. Had to unlearn and relearn lots of JS later on.- There’s something to be said for all-JS bootcamps like Hack Reactor if you want to be a front-end dev (like me). But I also appreciated learning programming fundamentals in a language like Ruby where I am purely focused on problem-solving.- The pace and the learning style is not for everyone. I do not learn best through lectures and it takes a little bit of time for new concepts to settle in. So I found myself writing TONS of notes during lectures and asking for one-on-one help from TAs or other students when I needed it.- Parts of the job search can be very one-size-fits-all. I get why it is this way and that there needs to be accountability but it could be frustrating.- Algorithms lectures at the end of the course feel like trying to cram 4 years of CS concepts into your brain in two weeks. Lots of room for improvement in the instruction and the structure.- Constant stress, feeling like the dumbest person on earth because you are around such smart people, beating up your body from long computer hours.- Tehama.TIPS:- DO THE PREP WORK. Do it twice. Study with other people before you start. You want to come into this strong and passing the first few assessments puts you in a far less stressful situation.- Do the practice assessments a million times. Especially if you are a slower or weaker student like me. Don’t slack on the weekend! If you drill hard all weekend you probably will not fail.- Sleep. Your brain needs it to work right.- Ask about deposit assistance if you cannot afford the full $5k deposit. There are some diversity scholarships and other ways you can work it out with them.- If you get the opportunity to do JumpStart for your admissions process I highly recommend it.Read Less",app-academy

Read More helped me for the first week or two of AppAcademy (they taught Ruby in the beginning so there were common elements between them). However, I would like to stress that although it helped, it does not mean you can slack off. I consider myself pretty much an average student in the class during the whole main curriculum.I do believe the course is really intense. I also believe if you really put in the effort and really REALLY try to understand what is happening, the course is really not too hard. Assessments are always scary regardless. Two failures is pretty much where most people get dropped out. We lost like 10 out of 56 within the first two weeks. The schedule is basically lecture from 9 to 12 and then do paired programming classwork for remainder of the day. I'll list out a few key points that I learned and thought helped me:The first key point is to NOT GO OUT OF YOUR WAY to try and complete the daily projects. I know it sounds wrong but it is the a very very important lesson I learned. The instructors will tell you in the beginning that you do not have to complete the projects. Although it feels nice to complete one, the key point of paired programming interaction is to try to understand the material as a pair and mutually benefit. This means if one does not understand it, the one who does should be able to explain it well enough to him/her. This also helps the person explaining reinforce what they learned. You should not feel the urge to complete the projects. They were not made to be completed by most people attending the course but merely as a teaching guide. So really focus on trying to understand material and how it works. Try to do the projects to the best of you and your partner's abilities but do not try to over commit to it. Everyone also learn at different speed. Do not feel ashamed if you do not get to a part in the project that another group got to. You will all learn the same thing in the end. It is a cumulative learning experience.Another tip I learned was to always get your rest. So this and previous tip I mentioned were my mistakes in the first few weeks. I really tried to complete the work after class and cut down my daily sleep to approximately 5 hours per night on the first two weeks. I felt like I had to get a bit ahead in order to not fall behind. However, the end result was that my performance was worse the next day due to the lack of sleep and I actually get behind on that and the cycle just repeats. Set up a bed time schedule and stick to it. Whatever you are doing for the curriculum (except progress reports) is not urgent enough compared to it. If you did not understand something for the homework, they will explain it in class the day after. After I decided to stuck to my sleep schedule, I never really struggled on my work (except the first solo day, it was really rough though). I also gave up sleep to work on my full stack project. It ended up costing me two days of actual productive work.I guess the next tip would be to just do the work. It is long and grueling. There are no shortcuts to learning. Just do the work and do your best to understand the homework material. Concepts can be explained by the lecture the following morning or TAs. I can guarantee you that you would not fail if you diligently listen to the these tips. I honestly never read the project ahead or even look at the solutions after the end of the day. For homework videos, you should start using video speed player and get adjusted to the speed. You do not want to watch 3 hours of videos at normal speed. Slow down/pause at parts that you don't understand.I struggled mostly on week 1 where I really felt like I was underprepared. I did the precourse but there was a large gap until I actually started my cohort. I also was experiencing the struggles listed from the tips above. I struggled on the first solo day and first week of javascript since it was pretty new material coming at you really quickly. I honestly think I broke down maybe once or twice during my fullstack project. I was really sleep deprived and afraid that I won't complete my project (I do not think anyone really fully cloned their project but they did AMAZING work!). Stick to the tips even during fullstack project! I failed to do so.Read Less",app-academy

Read More long history of playing around with computers, but no academic CS background. My academic background is in the humanities (philosophy and theology) and I spent the first six years after college in grad school, then teaching, then working at a small magazine. The course is extremely intense. (I say this as someone who graduated in the top 10% of my class at Yale.) About 25% of my cohort was asked to leave because they couldn't keep up with the pace. That said, the instructors do a good job of helping you through each day, and the structure of the course itself, from one day to the next, is very thoroughly regimented. If you do the course, I recommend surrendering to the routine as much as possible. There is always more work to do—you will almost never finish a day's projects. The name of the game is to struggle for 14+ hours, get some sleep, and then struggle again the next day. You will work on weekends, you will not have a day off before week ten (and if you think you do, you're probably making a mistake). If you can keep up, you will find that the rate of your learning is really high.A typical day goes as follows: you arrive at the office by ~8:45am in advance of the morning checkin and go to your assigned seat for the day, with your partner for the day. 9 - 9:30am is spent doing a CSS exercise. 9:30 to about noon is spent in lecture (lectures have built-in Q&amp;A time, and a five minute break in the middle). Lectures cover everything from O(n) and implementing backend Auth to meta-programming in Ruby and state structure design in Redux. Lectures are generally reinforcement of the essential concepts from the previous night's readings and homework. This means they tend to be more basic, and more Q&amp;A oriented than the readings—as a result they can feel boring if you understood the readings right away, but the reinforcement is essential. At 12:30 there's a lunch break, which continues until 1:45pm. Some people work on homework during lunch, but the instructors encourage students to take the time to have a break. At 1:45 there's another checkin, after which you resume work with your partner, starting the day's projects. There are usually two or three projects, the first one deals with implementing the concepts in the day's lecture, and then the subsequent projects tend to be more advanced extensions of the same material. You will rarely get through the second project of the day. Many days you won't even finish the first. At 6pm an instructor dismisses the class and makes any announcements or reminders. After 6pm about 1/4 of the cohort will stay behind to complete their homework at the office. Most people go home to do the homework, which is usually ~3 hours, depending on the number of recorded lecture segments and readings. After finishing the homework, students are expected to review the solutions to the day's projects, and read through the next day's project instructions in advance.That's life for the first 7 weeks of the course. Assessments are usually on Mondays or Wednesdays. They're terrifying, very difficult to prepare for, and intense, but if you do what the instructors tell you to do to study, and use the provided resources, the test itself should go fine. In the 8th week the typical lecture/project/homework schedule goes away and students spend about 10 days doing individual full-stake projects. This building a production-ready clone of a major web application (facebook, airbnb, etc.) from scratch, on your own. Project presentations happen at the end of week 9, after which the jobsearch curriculum begins. This is three weeks of lecture, independent projects, application/interview prep, etc. (That's where I'm at right now). If I remember, I'll come back and update this review once some time passes so I can assess the program in light of its key promise: to help you get an engineering job. As things stand, it could hardly have been better, except in minor ways here and there (a few unclear assignments, a few weak lectures), but as a learning experience it's up in the top experiences of my life. Totally practical, radically empowering. I learned a lot. And continue to learn about as much in the past two months as I think I could have.Read Less",app-academy

Read More they reviewed it) in order to receive the hoody. Take that for what it is and if students would be capable of providing honest and unbiased feedback.My experience at aA has its ups and downs. I would say the environment that aA has created is great. Maybe I was fortunate with my class but my classmates were great and the staff I worked with at the time were extremely helpful.My issues with aA has more to do with how it is run from a systematic level. So I will list a few things to see if aA is the right environment for you, after going through it, personally it was not the right environment for me.The curriculum is extremely fast paced and loaded with work. If you have no coding foundation, you will easily put 80+ hours a week if you want to keep up. If you don't understand something, you may ask a question, hopefully the TAs or your classmates can help you. If you learn well under stress, then aA will be a good fit. I reached a point where my foundation was not strong with databases and it all fell downhill from there. There was a domino effect of playing catch up while trying to learn the new material. It did not work for me as new material was continually being given but I was already trying to play catch up. That is not how I learn, and I know most students in the program felt the same way as well.They have recently switched their pricing strategy, so maybe they are working to change the culture but this comment is made with the deferred tuition in mind.aA is a business first so their goal is to pump out students and for you to get a job. aA doesn't earn money in most cases unless you get placed. With that being said, the job search curriculum is fully driven by you. The expectation is to send around 40 applications a week (they have a strike system to try and keep you to that). The career support is not as developed as I was hoping. Your assigned "career" coach would normally just touch bases with you once a week, see what you are up to and maybe give a suggestion. They have very few formalized events (meetups, workshops) for those who are still looking for work to make their candidates more attractive.During the job search period (period after you finish the 3 month program), you are not allowed to leave SF or NY of within 40 miles without consent as they considered that a violation of your contract. And you are not allowed to work while you are looking for a job. If the job search goes long (you are not allowed to work unless you receive approval), be aware of that coming in.It should be noted that the job search stats are not voluntarily audited by a third party. I would take the numbers they have listed with a grain of salt on job placement and salary. The bootcamp markets is growing extremely rapidly (more competition for entry level) and yearly computer science enrollment for undergraduate has increased 3 to 4 folds (again more competition for entry level position) so the salary for entry level is starting to depress (from talks with recent aA graduates).Knowing what I experienced now, I would not recommend aA to the everyday person. If you are software developer that wants to learn the new technologies in web development, I think it would be a good fit. But if you are the everyday person, I would recommend to look at other boot camps or other alternatives (college) because I don't think the fundamental structure of the curriculum is the best learning environment for most people (high stress, fast, pile on work). With that said, I wish you all the best to those who are considering making the switch to software!

Read More in finance, I'm now earning almost double what I was previously (plus I'm in a junior/entry-level role, so that should increase with time/experience), I'm doing something that I love, and I get to work in a relaxed environment (busy, for sure, but it's fun, without any of the stilted corporate rules, like a 50's-era dress code, etc., that I left behind in finance). I have App Academy to thank for this, hence the 5 stars.So I'm happy to report that it's all pretty much as advertised. It's a rigorous 3 month course that will consume your entire life at the time, but you'll learn a ton, make great friends, and be able to land a fun and lucrative position (eventually) to kickstart your new career in software engineering.That said, something that wasn't fully emphasized to me upfront is that the job search can become a long, drawn out, exhausting process that I found much harder and less rewarding (at least in the short term) than the 3 months of intense coding. I believe the "average" job search time estimated when I first applied was "3 months", which was then later verbally estimated at "4 to 5 months", and ultimately ended up being 10 months, in my case.Don't get me wrong; we had one student from our cohort who had a job within 2 weeks of graduating and a healthy number of others had new jobs within the first few months, but many others had job searches much longer than that. Some landed jobs at Google/YouTube, Yelp, Dropbox, etc., while others at smaller startups, and many took on temporary contract work or internships; there's not a single path here, so there's diversity in the success stories and App Academy is pretty flexible in supporting you however you get there.In other words, I'd keep that in mind and plan accordingly; you might get a job right away, but more likely it will take months, and could very well take almost a year to get an offer, in which case you need to be mentally/financially prepared for that going in. There's a lot of rejection involved when trying to get your foot in the door and all of these companies receive hundreds, if not thousands, of applications. If you're skilled at networking, you'll likely fare much better.You may have heard how much of a shortage there is for software engineers in the industry right now, but if you check out the job boards (or just attempt the job search), you'll soon find that the shortage is actually for experienced mid-to-senior level engineers, as there is an abundance of junior engineers coming from colleges, self-taught individuals, or one of the many bootcamps, which each churn out about 70 - 80 new junior engineers every three months, with largely the same technical background.In any case, even though it took me a grueling 10 month job search to finally fulfill the dream, I'd definitely do it again, love what App Academy's given me, and am really excited to grow in my new career.I can't recommend App Academy enough; just remember that it actually gets harder after the initial 3 month coding program and that you may not feel relieved or at rest until you ultimately accept an offer.Thanks, a/A!Read Less",app-academy

There are weeks where you have to essentially code from morning until night with not much time for anything else. After you learn everything you need to build apps, you learn how to get a job. That entails applying to dozens of postings every week, and it could take months. Throughout this entire process, I felt like a freak, but had 70 friends right alongside doing it with me. They helped me when I was stuck, and more importantly, brought me up when I was down. I don't know if I could've ever pushed myself that hard to get a job on my own, but with my cohort, the process was streamlined and almost (dare I say it) fun.App Academy teaches a really diverse range of topics so the constant work you're doing is never boring. It's hardly even repetitive, and in fact, you will likely not fully understand most topics until you get to practice them again after the curriculum is over. In the end, App Academy didn't just teach me how to use React and Ruby on Rails. They taught me how to program, how to binge-learn any framework or language, how to speak to others in the field, and how to value myself, find a job, and negotiate as a Software Engineer.

At the time, I felt that I really wouldn't learn too much programming principals but instead learn some frameworks and syntax with whatever boot camp I applied to. Well I was wrong.

Much of passing the tests are memorization. The positive to this is that they are very selective (3% admittance rate like the other top boot camps) but in contrast to the other boot camps this one will continue filtering out students that they feel aren't going to work out in programming where as others will just push them through it. This makes the a/A brand an extremely strong mark on your resume. Overall, I suggest attending this boot camp if you have confidence in your ability to program going into it, but perhaps take a few timed tests or join their Jump Start or boot camp prep program to see if you will cut it if you're unsure.Read Less",app-academy

CurriculumThe curriculum is easily the strongest part of App Academy. It is truly incredible how much knowledge you will walk away with if you are able to pace yourself and be consistent in doing all of the readings and preparing for the lectures everyday. They offer a lot, but they also require a lot out of you and it is difficult to keep up unless you are able to motivate yourself everyday.Luckily they provide intrinsic motivation due to pair programming and assessments. Knowing that you have to work with a different person everyday helps you make sure to try to get a good understanding of the subject matter so that you don't slow your partner down. Most importantly knowing that you could be kicked out by failing too many assessments will also motivate you to keep up. This was a main motivator for me attending, because I knew it would always keep me on my toes.At the end of the main curriculum you will be able to build a fullstack web application that is dynamic, complex, and impressive. That ten day project will be one of the most tiring experiences of your life, but you will be quite proud when you are done. Be sure to celebrate with your cohort mates when it's over.DiversityI added this category because I think it's important to note that App Academy is below average when it comes to racial/gender diversity. My cohort was about 5% women and 10-15% non white/asian. This did not affect my experience at all, as someone from an under-represented group, but I cannot speak for everyone and thought it should be noted for others considering App Academy.InstructorsThe instructors are usually App Academy grads. There is a question button during pair programming, which calls over a TA to assist you when you and your partner are stuck. They are all very cool, helpful, and the lectures are incredibly informative. The lectures will usually go over the reading and assignments for the night before and introduce some new material for the day ahead, so make sure you come prepared. Job AssistanceThe Job Search Curriculum in the last three weeks can feel a bit anticlimactic. You've just spent 9 weeks going 100mph and then all of the sudden things slow down quite a bit. It can be a good thing because everyone is a bit burnt out from the fullstack project, but I wish there was a way to keep a similar pace going. Here you will work on your portfolio, build a nice online presence, learn how to approach networking, applying, negotiating etc. Don't come in thinking App Academy is going to provide you with all kinds of contacts and connections. I don't think they have any more ability to get you a job than any other bootcamp. However, they have a great reputation with companies in NYC and SF and a huge alumni network in those respective cities. I attended App Academy in NYC and I can tell you there are companies that only hire App Academy grads because the curriculum is more in depth and the projects are more impressive. OutcomePersonally, I applied to 305 jobs, had 6 phone screens, 3 on-sites, 2 offers, and landed an awesome job at a startup in NYC 3 months after graduating and I couldn't be happier. The job search is an absolute grind, but don't get discouraged. Just stick with it, apply everywhere, and don't say no to yourself! You never know who will get a job, even if everyone applies to the same one. There is a lot of luck involved and each person is unique even though you all graduated from the same course.Be financially responsible, make sure you have enough of a safety net so that you can focus, and it'll all come together in the end.Read Less",app-academy

If I remember, I will go back and edit this after going through the job search. I have greatly enjoyed my time at App Academy so far. Looking back, it is astounding how much... Read More ground we have covered in that time. Myself and all my classmates have just finished our full stack web applications—and it amazes me how far we were able to take them. I remember sitting in the classroom on the first day, apprehensive and excited to start learning… since then it has been a whirlwind of learning and doing. You will look back and marvel at how far you have come in so little time. That being said, this program is hard work. You will need to steel yourself for long nights and stressful exams and projects. Some, of course, will have an easier time than others depending on your background and how well you’ve prepared for the bootcamp. But at one point or another, everyone who gets through puts in a lot of time and effort to do so.I have often been running on 5-7 hours of sleep—less on particularly intensive nights. I estimate I’ve put in roughly 80-90 working hours a week (more if you include my commute each day). If you want to keep up and get all the readings/activities done, expect to be spending many hours learning and coding. Fortunately, if you’re anything like me and most of my cohort-mates, then you’ll enjoy learning software development. By this point you’ve probably read a lot of reviews telling you App Academy is hard for many people. This is true. Some do not make it to the end. About 15 people from our class failed two assessments and a retake and were asked to leave as a result. However, I am a firm believer that if you’ve gotten through the applications process at App Academy, you have what it takes to make it to the end. If you end up going to App Academy, please believe in yourself, and work your ass off. A good number of my classmates failed the first assessment (by far the easiest one), bunkered down, and killed the rest. Do not be discouraged if you stumble. I’d like to close my review with some advice for prospective students. I have done fairly well with the program thus far and think it is prudent of my to share some of my preparation and study strategies that got me to where I am.1.	If you’re looking for introductory materials, I definitely recommend the MIT eDX course, ‘Introduction to Programming in Python’2.	Do as much preparation as possible. Of particular help to me was training fundamentals in Ruby on codewars. Aside from that, do what interests you from the options below:a.	Learn HTML5 and CSS3 at least to a basic level. In particular, learn the basic input types for html and how to use flex in CSS (look up flexbox froggy). If you can, try and recreate static versions of popular webpages from pure html and css.b.	Learn SQL. We did this is about half a week, but it was pretty rough for some. If you’re dedicated, you can do the same and not have to stress about it during the course.c.	Learn about the Model, View, Controller design pattern and its advantages/tradeoffs. Research ruby/rails or some other framework and see if you can learn the basics of app development. I would not recommend doing this before having a solid grounding in all the fundamentals though.d.	For the mathematically inclined with time before the course begins, go follow along with an algorithms course online. Learn big-O notation and algorithmic analysis. I personally followed along with the free MIT OCW lectures and assignments for 6.042J with Tom Leighton and 6.006 with Srini Devadas. If you already feel comfortable with basic programming and want to be ahead of the game for the job search, this is a good option for you. e.	If you really want to go the extra mile like me, go ahead and read a design patterns book (I used Head First Design Patterns, but Gang of Four is the canonical work to reference)3.	During the course, hit the ground running and do all the readings you can. Definitely drop all other responsibilities (or as many as possible). You don’t want to be dealing with anything else while tackling the curriculum. If you have a decent commute, it will be fairly impossible to do anything else. Speaking of the commute, preload the readings and download the videos they give you so you can watch them offline on your way there/back. If you can, study in the office around others where you can ask your classmates questions. If the homework is taking you too long, just send it up and put it away—you will be going over the material in greater detail tomorrow. 4.	Lastly, and most importantly: Make friends! You have the opportunity to study alongside many with similar motivations and career goals. Your classmates will be among your greatest resources during the course and moving forward. The people who are thriving in my cohort are largely those who made an effort to be social work with their classmates. Coming in to week 9, I can count a number of my them as good friends who I can expect to keep in contact with for years to come. For that reason alone, it was worth it to me to attend App Academy, and they’ve made my time here feel so nice. Good luck to all applicants and soon-to-be students!Read Less",app-academy

I'll discuss some reservations I had about App Academy, and some tips for future applicants/attendees. I come from a liberal arts background, and have never... Read More taken a computer science course before I started Jumpstart (a great way to get ready for App Academy's admissions process if you are offered a spot in the program). To be honest, I had reservations about the price tag of App Academy and whether it would be worth it ($22k+ is a lot of money).But as the course progressed, those reservations disappeared as I really realized that there was absolutely no way that I could have learned the amount of material on my own in such a short period of time. Prior to App Academy, I had a pretty decent job with great benefits at a private university, and part of the reason why I decided to leave that job was because of the amount of waste that I saw funded by student debt and high tuition prices. In contrast, App Academy's model of deferred tuition is still pretty revolutionary even if you have to pay a $5k deposit. I think part of what makes it work is that the student to instructor ratio is pretty low (I think it's around 1 to 8 or maybe 1 to 7 as we did loose 12 members of our cohort who did not pass the assessments). Again, that sort of student to instructor ratio is not something that is possible in most higher ed settings. There are 6 assessments throughout the course, and if you fail 2 (you are offered one opportunity for a retake after the second assessment), you are asked to leave the course. This causes a super stressful environment where many of the students are scared of failing out. The assessments do force you to internalize the material in a way that you probably wouldn't if you didn't have the assessments. In my opinion, the assessments are a flawed tool for measuring student progress, especially because it causes a lot of students to focus on just what would/could be on the test, but it is App Academy's way of measuring that you have the minimum amount of knowledge to continue progressing in the course (as I do think a few cohort mates who were asked to leave could have done well and finished if they had been allowed to stay). Aside from 1.5 to 2 hours of lecture, most of your day is spent pair programming with the same person for the whole day (for some projects, two days). Pair programming really does help you solidify your understanding, as you have to verbally communicate your thoughts to another person and vice versa, and forces you to stay on track the whole day. Except for maybe 2 instances, I found pair programming to be a very enjoyable experience. I will say that even if you've never taken a computer science course, and even if you struggle to keep up throughout most of the course, if you are comfortable with pushing your boundaries and keep up with the course material, you can succeed. Prior to starting the actual course, App Academy gives you materials (Alpha course) to study on your own. Make sure you do all of it (twice, if possible!) and give yourself time to do it. This will set you up for success. They recommend 4 weeks for this prep work, but especially if you plan on working right up till you start the course, I would say you need more like 6 to 8 weeks. The last thing I wanted to say was aside from the mental exertion and total time commitment for 12 weeks, I found the course to be physically grueling, and felt absolutely exhausted the first two weeks of the course. So, I think this is also something to keep in mind when considering which bootcamp to attend. But overall, I highly recommend App Academy!Read Less",app-academy

Read More toes into the tech industry with this company, and having some familiarity with coding through Codecademy, I explored online how I could gain the skills I needed to have a career in tech.At first, I did an online graduate course through a university. The curriculum had holes (and it would have taken 2 years to get the degree). Based on that experience, I decided to look into coding bootcamps. I found out about App Academy through SwitchUp, which appeared as the top result of my google search.Looking through the different programs listed, not all of them had full-stack curricula. When I applied to some of them, all they had was a Skype interview and maybe some online prep material. App Academy stood out in that it had practice problems to solve, then an online coding challenge, then a technical interview, then an interview for cultural fit. It had by far the most fleshed-out, formal process from my experience.In addition, the deferred tuition model is appealing. But bear in mind the corresponding risks. If you have been a strong student academically or have prior experience coding, you will very likely make it through App Academy's curriculum. However, as App Academy scales, the 5% dropout rate of old is inaccurate--it's more like 20-25% in recent cohorts. The upside is that if things don't work out, you don't pay 100% of the cost. The downside is if you really want to get into software development, getting kicked out would really hamper that.How App Academy frames it is whether or not things work out for you, i.e. you are able to learn what they teach. Let me say: the curriculum is superb, the environment is supportive, and you are able to fail 2 of the 6 unit assessments and still make it through if you pass the retake of the second test.So as you compare your options, consider whether you are willing to pay $17,000 upfront to another top-rated full-stack program that won't kick you out, or if you believe you will respond well to App Academy's incentives and view the coding bootcamp more as a way to discover whether or not you want to be a software developer.All that said, if you make it through, you will build a clone of a major tech site. You will understand how the frontend, the backend, the database, middleware, and everything else functions. You will have a culture which facilitates a transition into tech extremely well (as you'll be pair-programming much of the day, every day).The last thing I'll note is that cultural fit is important.

It also became evident that most students came from educated, middle-class backgrounds and didn't have anything to lose by quitting their jobs to enroll in a coding bootcamp. Coding bootcamps are a business, period. But I personally believe that because they advertise themselves as a sort of trade-school-esque-alternative to college, they should make an effort to market themselves to the communities that statistically enroll less in 4-year colleges: individuals from working-class backgrounds and select minority communities. Bottom-line: the curriculum is fantastic, the people are great. just be prepared for a lot of work and a relatively sterile and uniform social environment for 3+ months.Read Less",app-academy

Read More top boot camps but App Academy was the best fit. Assessments:There are 6 assessments. First fail is free. If you fail a second assessment, you have a chance to retake. If you pass the retake, great! However you can't fail another assessment or you'll be dismissed. If you don't pass the retake, you are immediately dismissed.My cohort lost ~20% of the students from failed assessments. However, all of the material tested on the assessments are KEY concepts that you will need on your full stack project.I don't recommend App Academy if you have severe test anxiety.Projects:1) Fullstack Project (Ruby on Rails Backend, Javascript React Front End): 10 days2) Javascript: 4 days3) Flex Project (3~4 member group project, incorporating new technology/api that wasn't used in class): ~10 daysCurriculum:- The key topics are intentionally repeated throughout the course to ensure that you'll remember these after course. For example, you'll learn back-end user authentication for Rails week 4. You'll study back-end user auth for one of the assessments. Then you'll learning front-end user authentication week 7. In week 8, you'll combine back-end and front-end for in class projects AND your full stack project.- There is are HUGE emphasis on having readable code (having good syntax + variable names so other people can understand your code), DRY code , and the importance of modularity. These are all key concepts to any software developer.- App Academy has a job search curriculum other top bootcamps do not have. You go over frequently interviewed topics.- Learning so many things in 3 months though is mentally tiring. However, don't give up. Just keep learning. Once a week, I'll question if App Academy made a mistake in accepting me. I'll hit a huge conceptual roadblock and feel inferior to my peers. However, no pain, no gain. Usually the day after, I'll have more time to reflect on what I just learned and be able to use those skills right away in the current project.Culture:- The culture is so welcoming and inviting.- I felt other bootcamps I was interested had a more top-down culture. App Academy is more collaborative. - The emphasis is to learn and grow, not just plow through the material as fast as possible.- You can tell the staff loves what they do. There are cute animal references and memes all throughout the curriculum/lectures.Pro-Tip: - Use your weekends to the fullest. Take time to look into next week's curriculum as well as solidify your knowledge from the past week.- Learn the basics on Javascript ES5 and ES6 before the curriculum starts.- Make sure you put your best effort in learning the pre-course material. You'll have an easier Week 1 if you do.- Try your best not to fall behind. Once you do, it's going to feel like a never ending battle balancing old material you didn't really know AND new material being thrown at you.Read Less",app-academy

As someone without a background I had to work constantly just to hang in there. Nearly everyday I was confused by what I was learning and that was definitely something hard to get used to. I’d never felt so impotent in my life. I averaged 5-6 hours of sleep at night and was slowly enveloped by a thick fog. The longer I went without sleep the more confusing and difficult things became. It got to the point I could barely remember the conversations I’d just had with people. Luckily I was always able to catch up on some sleep during the weekend and get back to ‘reality’ for a couple of days. If you are planning to take the course you should know that if you want to succeed the course will have to be your life. This is difficult to maintain, but it is possible.	In hindsight I believe I may have taken somewhat of the wrong approach to the course (although I don’t regret the way I accomplished it). I did everything they told us to do. I did all the readings and all the homeworks every night. This is the reason for my lack of sleep. I tried to do everything, and many of my fellow classmates did not. I think I allowed myself to get so tired that the work I was doing wasn’t helping as much as it was hurting me. 	If you’re looking just to pass the course, I believe it may be pretty easy. All the exams were very very closely related to the given practice exams. If you know how to memorize a practice exam and other topics that may appear on the exam, the exams are easy. You should be able to take the practice exam in half the expected time. If you can do that, I believe you will pass the real exam. There weren’t really any curveballs. 	That said we did lose many classmates from the exams. A student was even sent home on the last exam. I believe we lost a total of 12 people, and started with 62. I believe that those students probably had tried to do too much and weren’t able to effectively learn the practice exams. 	It’s a tough course and it’s important to make good friends throughout the program. Don’t count on being comforted by the staff. It’s required to fill out progress reports every night, but then you are given the impression that no one ever reads them. It’s like shouting into the wind. I was never once approached to discuss my ideas or encouraged to keep up the good work. 	But the community is great and you feel an unspoken bond with everyone in the course. We’re all suffering together. 	You will learn the curriculum that they advertise and you will become a fullstack developer. 	I am about to start the job search curriculum of the program and hope that I will be able to find a job. I do feel that I have learned a lot since I started and look forward to continuing my education. 	The rating is hard for me to give because I am yet to know how effective I will be at securing a job.Read Less",app-academy

Read More the program, have come out with a complete entry-level knowledge of full-stack development. The resources that have helped me from getting from point A to B in such a short amount of time was the rigor and depth of a/A’s curriculum. The most important reason is that the curriculum is so effective is that class-time enforces students to be immersed in programming and coding challenges for a maximum amount of time. The pair-programming aspect of the curriculum is a strong way to enforce communication skills and forces students to have a deeper understanding of new lessons when they are encouraged to explain their thought-process to their peers. The quality of said peers is also generally excellent in terms of character and ability. While pairing chemistry will never be perfect between every student, it was always evident to me that my peers took their time in the program very seriously and were always concerned with learning the material deeply, preparing for each class adequately, and producing high-quality work. The teaching staff is also generally excellent. I found that the quality of individual instructors would often correlate to their time in the program, but because the curriculum is so intense, the more junior instructors themselves also appear to improve quite rapidly. While there was sometimes a quality gap between new and veteran instructors, the actual time-difference between the former and the latter was usually only a cohort or two. And generally, I found that the entire package of TAs, who do all of the teaching at App Academy, was excellent and foundational to my own learning in the program.As for the cons, the largest is definitely the intense and disheartening aspects of the assessment structure of the curriculum. Personally, the assessments were the most important reason that I spent so much time working and studying outside of class hours. This is because if you fail two assessments, plus a single retake opportunity, you are dismissed from the course. With a weekend full of intense studying, I personally found the assessments to be fair and the course will give preparation materials that strongly correspond to the actual assessment. On the other hand, sometimes peers cannot make it through the grind of assessments: I believe that these individuals that were dismissed from the program do have the potential to be good programmers in the working world, and it was likely the pace of the curriculum, more so than its sheer technical difficulty, that was the largest hump to get over. Overall, my advice to prospective future students is that if you are confident in your programming abilities coming into the first week of the program, expect to still spend a lot of time on assessments and digesting the enormous amount of material from the week prior. If you are coming in less-confident, or even worse, having rushed through the four weeks of prep work, then expect to spend an extraordinary amount of time (and lack of sleep) on keeping your head above water. While the assessment structure does force students to master the material, for the most part, the stressful atmosphere that it creates through the whole school is an unfortunate trade-off.Finally, I wanted to comment on the quality of the facilities, which is important because students spend most of their hours here. During my cohort, the New York office got a significant upgrade in amenities and privacy. Before, both concurrent cohorts shared a single loft space with poor water pressure, mediocre bathrooms, and sometimes inconsistent internet. Now, each cohort gets their own floor to work on, and the office space includes a decent kitchen setup outfitted with utensils, plateware, drinking mugs/glasses, and a dishwasher. Most importantly, the coffee and teas offered by the building were significant upgrades over Folgers and Lipton. These small touches, for me, actually made a tremendous quality-of-life improvement; since most of our time will be in front of screens in the office, it’s good that the peripheral comforts are well-appointed.All-in-all I would recommend App Academy to those who want to make a tremendous career shift to a good field in the least amount of time possible. My warnings are regarding its pace, difficulty, and the toll it can take on your personal well-being.Read Less",app-academy

This is especially true when students (most usually do) take the deferred tuition model, which means not paying full tuition until accepting a full-time job offer. You can really tell that everything they do is to try to set you up for success. The work space is available 24/7 and there's always a TA available to help, whether it be in person or on Slack. It is important to note that while everything is laid out for your success in the course, how far you'll go is 100% dependent on the work that you put in. Due to there being no grades (aside from weekly assessments), it is sometimes easy for students to overlook some homework assignments and projects. If you're someone who likes to barely scrape by and do the bare minimum, then you're going to be in for a bad time. I had a few pairs I worked with that did not complete any readings and seemed very behind and those people ended up being the ones asked to leave after failing two assignments. On the contrast, those who study JUST for the assessments and put other parts of the curriculum on the backburner may pass all of them, will sometimes end up hurting themselves during final projects and end up having to relearn a lot of concepts that were not covered in the assessments. You really do get what you put into the program and knowing/balancing what concepts to focus on becomes a really important thing to learn over the course of the 12 weeks. Overall, App Academy was definitely worth it for me. If you're looking for a change in your life and you think that web development may be for you, I would urge you to apply.

Read More I HIGHLY recommend doing it - you get a great taste of what the real program is like, including overall instruction-style, assessments, pair-programming, basic material, etc. and it reportedly greatly improves your chances of getting accepted into the program). Review: Overall, I would say that App Academy lives up to its ranking and is a great experience for turning someone like me, with absolute minimal tech / coding background, and in just 3 months turning this person into someone who can create a web app from scratch and can comfortably apply to jobs in that field. That being said, everything everyone says about the workload and intensity is completely accurate and you need to take it seriously. I gave up the vast majority of my life's activiities outside of a/A out of necessity - you really need to put in every weeknight and most of your every weekend into catching up if you're behind, getting ahead if you're not, or studying for the next week's assessment. Being someone who wasn't as naturally gifted or previously trained in the field, I had to work much, much harder and put in way more effort than those people so that I could still contribute and be productive in my daily pairings, projects, assessments, etc. Pairing - I found the pair-programming experience to be one of the most educational and enjoyable aspects of the program. Every day you are assigned a new partner to work with for the entirety of that day. You work through (and rarely complete) all of the day's projects together and over that time end up learning a lot, both about the person and about the day's material. Whether you find yourself to be the faster/more knowledgeable of the pair, or the slower/less knowledgeable, you end up learning at least a few things by day's end. Sometimes your partner will know a few cool keyboarding shortcuts in Atom that you hadn't seen before, or they will know some tidbit about Javascript formatting that you end up following yourself every time after, or they will have some alternative strategy to solving a problem that you find much easier to follow than the normal methods. I didn't have a single bad pairing experience in all 7 weeks of my pairings, half the time you end up eating lunch with your partner and talk, and most of the time by the end of the day you end up befriending one more person in your cohort. While everyone is learning the material at different speeds, you find that there are no "dumb" people in your cohort, every one is highly intelligent in different ways; they are the 2% that made it in with you and each is inherently capable of getting through it. Assessments - The assessments were definitely one of the more difficult aspects for me. The assessment policy is: out of 6 assessments in the first 8 weeks of the program, if you fail 2 of them (failure usually being defined around 85%), you are asked to leave the program, that day. This is where I find my only cons with the program. Having to leave the program that day, in front of all of your classmates, is downright brutal and borderline humiliating. If anything it motivates you that much more in your studying to avoid such an experience but I still think it is overly harsh - a simple email that night instead would be a less degrading situation, in my opinion. I also don't like that because of this intense "Survivor"-style policy, I was often put into the very difficult situation of having to choose between fully completing the readings/videos, and hw assignments for the weekend, or studying sufficiently for that week's assessment to avoid expulsion. While I tried to balance this as best as I could and ultimately did make it through, I hated having to make that decision each week and having to compromise my getting-ahead for that week. To get you through all of it, there is an amazing team of warm, highly-gifted instructors and TA's who come to your aid either in person or online at the push of a button and explain concepts and bugs to you until both of you are confident that you fully understand, all of your highly-motivated, chill-mannered classmates, and of course, Google :).Read Less",app-academy

The overall pace of the course is extremely fast, and it challenges your studying habits and your ability to overcome nearly incomprehensible material being thrown at you at lightning speed. 9 hours of class time per day along with hours of homework each night means that you end up eating and breathing code for 70-90 hours per week. Weekly assessments are given to ensure that everyone is on track, and two failures means you get removed; about a dozen people from the cohort didn't make it to the end and it kinda sucks seeing them leave. You could feel the stress hormones through the roof, and over half of the cohort experienced failing one assessment and the doomsday mindset that followed. There was an unfortunate tradeoff between fully understanding the material and studying for the assessments, and most people opted for leaving the understanding to after the assessments were over. I did not experience the stress that most people did, but it's common enough to be worth mentioning. That being said, the amount that you end up learning is quite impressive. No one could learn all this through self-study at the pace that they teach it here. At the end of nine weeks, I found myself with a fully functional single-page web app built on Rails and React/Redux, which was super cool (too bad they don't teach this kind of stuff in college). The pair programming was also a great experience - you find yourself developing soft skills and becoming more eloquent at communicating, which are of utmost importance to the job search. My classmates were all super chill and bright folks, and it was an absolute pleasure to be working alongside them and pairing with them every day. I can't say I miss pair programming, but I can say I enjoyed it a lot and experienced a lot of growth that I never experienced when I was self-teaching programming.I feel prepared for the job search, and I know that I will be much more successful in the search than I would have been had I tried to pursue this path through self-study.Read Less",app-academy

Everyone in my cohort was a joy to work with and they were all super smart and super helpful. The test structure forces you to learn the test more that learn the fundamentals.

Read More 13 since there's about 4 weeks of prepwork assigned before the course starts), I've gone from 0 experience as a web developer to having created my own full stack web app using a Ruby on Rails backend with a React with Redux frontend. I can't speak yet to the quality of their job search curriculum, which I will go through over the next 3 weeks, but I will say that their full stack curriculum is absolutely effective for a few reasons. First, you should know that some of the students, roughly 15% in my cohort, were dismissed for not passing assessments before completing the curriculum, so being accepted is only the beginning of the journey. The ones who made it through are absolutely better programmers for having gone through the program. Many of my classmates started with little to no experience programming, and are full-fledged web developers now.I believe the reason a/A is so effective is, in a word: reps. Every day, there are 2 hours of lecture, and then you peer program for 5-6 hours. Then there are homeworks and readings to do before you get to class. Shower, sleep, and repeat for 9 weeks. Peer programming is a process through which you sit down and talk through and try to solve problems with someone else. There are many factors conducive to learning and skill development at play during this time. First, learning to verbalize your approach to a problem is immensely helpful to refining and solidifying knowledge. Second, having the accountability to keep trying to solve the problem and having help when you need it keeps the learning process moving. Third, an understated part of programming is looking up and researching documentation, which you will get a lot of practice doing. Last but not least, you are experiencing the same thing while you drive and your partner navigates, so you have the benefit of differing perspectives every day. Before I started a/A, I thought these skills were something I could learn on my own, but would be faster with a teacher. That's partly true, but it's also true that your fellow students aid in the learning process immensely. If I were describing a/A to a prospective applicant, I would tell you to look at it as an opportunity. An opportunity to work hard and learn. That's all it is. It's intense, but if you make it out, you will have absolutely developed hard, bankable skills as a programmer.Read Less",app-academy

I learned to develop web apps from scratch in just twelve weeks.",10/22/2017,2017-10-22,NULL,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"General Summary: I wholeheartedly enjoyed my twelve weeks at App Academy. The program provides an intense, unique experience. Basically, it lasts twelve weeks: the first nine weeks comprise the “Technical Curriculum” and the last three the “Job Search... Read More Curriculum”. However, after being admitted and accepting your offer, you have to complete a one-month online course called “Alpha Prep” before starting. The technical curriculum is intense. In seven weeks, you will learn all the material you need to be able to develop your own React/Rails web app from scratch in the eighth and ninth weeks. On a daily basis, you will have many projects (whose material you covered in readings and videos the night before) to work on with your partner. You’ll learn Ruby, Postgresql, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and React/Redux. However, pair programming and the “question button” system serve to alleviate some of the stress of the course. Pair programming is basically you coding on a single pc (and keyboard) with a partner. Every fifteen minutes, you switch “drivers”, i.e., the person who is physically typing on the keyboard. For the first couple of days, you might feel uncomfortable having to code all day with a partner, but the benefits of doing so become apparent soon after. Having to verbalize and communicate problems to someone else rather than hacking away at the keyboard forces you to become methodical in your approach, and it helps you ask better questions when you’re stuck. The “question button” is a button on the internal web app that puts your name on a question queue. The TA’s are pinged every time a person is added, and they come by to field students’ questions on a first-come, first-served basis. The benefit of this system is that it allows all students an equal opportunity to have their questions answered and it deals with the issue of less vocal or visible students receiving less attention. The job search curriculum begins in the tenth week. By that point, you will have learned all the skills you need to develop fully functioning web apps from scratch. However, simply because you have learned the technical material doesn’t mean the course becomes less intense. In these three weeks, you will work on your résumé, cover letters, online presence, personal pitch, and whiteboarding problems. In this aspect of the course, you will receive a lot of support from the career coaches. They will review your projects portfolio, résumé, etc, in depth and will give you detailed pointers on how to improve each item.	Pros:	The TA’s are always on call, and they generally are able to pinpoint your problem within seconds and do not leave you until all your doubts are assuaged.Almost the projects serve some practical use, and the emphasis on repetition ensures that you internalize the material.Pair programming makes the experience more enjoyable, and it ensures that you rarely get bogged down with trivial bugs.The career coaches provide a lot of support in the job search. They help with your portfolio, personal pitch, networking skills, online presence, and negotiation.App Academy’s alumni network is helpful and supportive.Cons:The curriculum is constantly being updated so sometimes you will find some inconsistencies in the material. This problem does not appear so much in the 12-week program itself, but it is definitely noticeable and distracting in the Alpha Prep course. As much as I love pair programming, you will have days where you work with someone you find intolerable. Fortunately, this only happened to me three days out of the roughly 35 in which you pair program, but this experience is variable.There are six assessments throughout the course, and they are a bit stressful because if you fail any two of them, you are asked to leave the program with your initial deposit refunded. Moreover, because they are graded automatically, they are unforgiving--meaning that a single typo can cause code with otherwise sound logic to fail their automated tests. However, the expectations of the assessments are straightforward and you are given plenty of time and material to prepare for them.Caveats:If you are not an independent learner, you will have a hard time at App Academy. Despite the great amount of support you will have, there is a lot of material and little time. If you assume App Academy is like a traditional educative program where the student plays a more passive role, you will likely struggle through it. This is not a criticism of the instructors (I hold them in high esteem), but it is simply the nature the program.You will not have time for anything else. This is not an exaggeration. I taught myself to code for half a year before attending App Academy so the first three weeks were relatively light for me. That being said, I was only able to have weekend evenings free during this time. When it came time to create our web apps from scratch, I literally had no time for anything else even on the weekend. Some people assume that the job search curriculum is less intense than the technical curriculum. This is not true so don’t get your hopes up!Read Less",app-academy

Read More the most difficult part of the entire process was the job search. I enjoy coding and solving problems but I absolutely hate sending emails and writing cover letters to try and 'sell' myself. This is not something specific to App Academy, but it is something to be prepared for. It took me over two months until I got an offer that I was happy with. About half of my cohort had to wait even longer. I know that doesn't sound like a long time but it IS when you're going through it. There were times that I didn't get any responses for weeks at a time and felt like I would never find a job.Pros:1. The tuition model. I applied when the tuition was 20% of the starting annual salary of the job I accepted. (They actually proactively lowered it to 18% because some students in my cohort had applied at that rate). For me, the low-risk payment model removed one of the greatest barriers to entry. It also gave me confidence that our goals were aligned and that success rates advertised were accurate (I too was skeptical before I experienced the outcomes first hand).2. The students. Once I got in, I began to appreciate that App Academy sets a high bar and selects only the top 3% of applicants. Learning with a group of talented and intelligent students becomes a real advantage when you get stuck, don't understand something, or just need to discuss a concept.3. The curriculum. The learning at App Academy follows a pattern of learning new material for homework, clarifying the details in the morning lecture, and hands-on experience in the afternoon projects. The curriculum is kept up to date with the latest stable technologies and focuses on applying the knowledge. For me, this helped in retaining what I had learned and cumulatively building upon it.4. The career coaching. My App Academy career coach was AWESOME! The career coaches help students polish their resumes, online profiles, and cover letter templates. They also help to find and fix the bottlenecks in the job search. (For me it was the online profiles and resume.

It's easy to feel overwhelmed but your fellow students and teachers are always there to help you. They have office hours everyday and people often stay late to do homework together if you need it. It helps to find people who live near you and make a study group.It's also great that part of the course is focused on job search and interviewing skills because I never felt like I knew anything about this. It was very helpful to learn about writing resumes and cover letters. The job coach I had was really insightful and I owe him a lot. You'll get lots of whiteboarding practice too which is great because it's so awkward the first time you do it.I met a lot of nice and interesting people and there's great diversity in the student body. The instructors are really dedicated and a/A recruits TA's from previous cohorts so they are on the same level and easy to talk to.In summary, I really liked the course and I think if you are serious about becoming a developer it's a great choice. Some of the curriculum needed refining but they are constantly improving everything. Lots of support and teachers are great! Be warned that it is INTENSE in every sense of the word.Read Less",app-academy

Pair programming is mandatory during most of App Academy's curriculum, a standard that encourages peer teaching outside of the normal class hours. This vibe sticks around, resulting in students that aren't competitive, but rather truly cooperative. Much of App Academy's value lies in their philosophy of pairing and peer teaching. Before applying to App Academy, I had read all the common sentiments in their reviews: "It was like drinking from a firehose", "You really will spend 100+ hours a week", "It was absolutely the most difficult and most rewarding thing I've ever done".

Read More my skill level without offering any instruction or legitimate curriculum. With App Academy, the application process was very challenging, but you are given every opportunity to succeed via their resources. Also, the actual challenges they give you are algorithm challenges, very similar to whiteboarding questions you may get when you interview for a Developer position. This is in contrast to other challenges that ask you to build a Rails Twilio application or some other project that is very practical in nature. Yes, building an application is a great way of finding out whether someone is a good programmer, but it tells you nothing of their potential. However, if you teach someone some basic programming principles and data structures: what is a string? an array? etc. and then ask them to solve a question that uses those data structures, it is a much better way to guage someones potential by seeing if they are capable of applying what they are learning. Building a full application is much too difficult a task to ask of a newbie without spelling out every step and at that point, you may as well just write the code for them.So aside from the deffered tuition (which is nice), the application process is what got me hooked on App Academy.Once you get in, first the first few weeks all you want to do is survive. You will be kicked out if you fail two exams. The first people to go are people who can't type (it's painful to watch them type with only their index fingers) and people who don't speak English as their first language. That's not to say that everyone who doesn't speak English as their first language will fail, not what I am saying. However, the sheer amount of information that will be thrown at you is mind numbing and every lick of it is in English. If there is no language barrier, you still only absorb ~75-85% of what you are taught. If there is a language barrier, that percentage drops. This makes it difficult to keep up in a very fast paced environment. I noticed the people who spoke English as a second language and did well in the class either had prior coding experience or were just insanely sedulous and dedicated to the craft. It can be done, but it is certainly harder.Once you make it past the survival phase, which is after the fourth assessment (say week 4), then you start to think, "Ok, I don't want to just survive anymore, I want to excel." This is where the course gets really exciting because you begin to see the light at the end of the tunnel. You start to think about things like a programmer. You get re-programmed. That's what this program does to you, it programs you to be a programmer (you like what I did there?).If you're smart, you may be wondering, "Well what are some flaws, some bad things about App Academy". The one thing I can point to, which I got over once I bought into the program is this: you are not attending a/A to create a startup when you graduate. I have a ton of ideas for startups, yes, but if it's one thing I learned during my time at a/A, it's that programming is very hard and it will take time (and more importantly, work experience) for you to be good. The goal of an a/A graduate is to get a job, not to start a company with a cool new application that revolutionizes an industry. Get a job, pay us back, get some experience, and then go start a company. That is the message and to be honest, I agree with it. Now some other bootcamps, like Full Stack Academy, have avenues for students to pursue their startup aspirations. This is a luxury that only a school who is already paid can afford. At a/A, they don't make money unless you do and most startups don't make money, they cost money (trust me, I know firsthand). Now, if they don't get paid unless you do, that means they have a vested interest in your getting paid. This system of deffered tuition is one that Milton Friedman espoused in his book Free To Choose. He devised this as a way to pay for education without the government paying for it, but admitted it would be very difficult to implement. Well, App Academy implemented and guess what, it works! The curriculum kicks ass. It is laid out in such a way that each topic builds on the next and moves very quickly so that every week your knowledge grows exponentially. I'm not going to go into specifics on the curriculum, the website does that. But I will say that I remember thinking often, "Wow, this curriculum is so good." Thank Ned Ruggeri et al!In summary, and this has been a long review, I highly recommend App Academy.Read Less",app-academy

You'll fail to understand a topic on a Saturday and pass an exam on it on Monday. Once the learning curriculum concludes, you're thrust into the job search, which is filled with entirely different challenges -- personal projects, phone calls, take-home assessments, technical screenings, whiteboarding sessions, in-person interviews, salary negotiations.And then, almost miraculously, things start working out. You get complimented on your GitHub code at interviews, you do well at whiteboarding sessions, you get offers that are almost double what you earned at your previous job. You have the confidence to choose which offers to accept and which to reject.A single review can't do AA justice. It truly provides a life-changing experience. The TAs are phenomenal --- amazingly brilliant people who not only understand the material but have a genuine desire to help others. The in-class pair programming assignments are perfectly structured; there is enough material to ensure a good 5-6 hours a day could be spent coding.

Even then, because of the sheer quantity of materials to learn, it behooves you to keep up and understand where you're at as best as possible. I didn't find the curriculum to be too stressful coming from a specialized high school/ medical school background. I also had a basic understanding of a lot of programming concepts, so I was definitely at a bit of an advantage over my classmates who had to teach themselves the basics of coding a month or two before starting the course. Generally speaking, if you made it past the interview process, you've got what it takes to pass the course. The job support portion is nice, but there are a lot of students so it might be difficult to pin down subtle issues you're having with the job search. If you reach out, though, you'll get the support you need.Some advice: SLEEP. Especially if you have an assessment the next morning. Your priority during boot camp MUST be in this order from most important to least important: Sleep, food, studying, everything else. If you do not sleep properly, you will not retain the information you're cramming, especially if it's all completely new. You will learn the most by doing what you read about the night before, and you won't be able to code the next day on no sleep and an empty stomach. Also, when you apply to jobs, apply to everything at once. You will have the best chances while all your projects are fresh. You have nothing to lose by getting in touch with hiring managers and CEO's of companies. Do what it takes and be sure to keep coding. Good luck.If you're just starting off your research into boot camps, a/A is one of the best, especially in NYC. You will need to save up a lot of money in order to support yourself and pay a deposit. I would recommend saving around $15k to be safe, $12k bare minimum.Read Less",app-academy

For the interview process, I checked out the resources provided by App Academy to prepare for the coding challenges and found them helpful for getting a good start. I went through every possible interview round there was.. first it was a timed coding challenge which I passed, but decided to attend their Jumpstart program where you have the chance to be accepted straight into the program if you pass their assessments (Which I highly encourage if you can make it out to SF for two weeks - just email them for more information about it). Unfortunately, I didn't pass Jumpstart, so I returned to SoCal and continued with my interview process.

Because they're also open on the weekends, I went to a/A every single day during the program. Take advantage of the study area since they have computers, a restroom, and a kitchen! Why go to a coffee shop and struggle to find open seats :) There were nights where I dreamt about code, went to sleep thinking about code, and woke up thinking about code. - Don't feel down if you see that those around you are doing a lot better than you, a lot of times I realized that those around me have either coded before, taken CS classes, or have prior experience. - Make sure to study well for the assessments, they are timed so make sure to practice taking them over and over and over again if you don't do well under pressure.- Staff/TA was great! They split everyone into smaller groups, so there's a good amount of TAs per group. We had weekly circle time where we went around in a circle and talked about our week which I really liked.Job Search:- My biggest challenge was to study algorithms, data structures, and mostly CS concepts since I did not have that background, but just study consistently the areas you feel you're weak at and practice.

While I can't really comment on the second aspect (haven't actually begun job hunting yet), at the end of the day if you want to learn how to quickly and effectively develop software AND have a great time with your cohort mates and TAs, a/A is undoubtedly one of the best places you can choose to attend. A few caveats that you should pay attention to. You have to eat, sleep and breath code. You have to constantly give more and more of your time and effort as the course progresses. As soon as you think things might start slowing down and you might have room to breath, the course will get more intense. So one of the best advice I can give to any one who gets accepted into a/A: KEEP UP WITH THE WORKLOAD, regardless of your daily schedule. The curriculum is one of the best, believe in it to teach you the skills you need as long as you can do what it tells you to do. On top of that the TAs (atleast in my "pod") are some of the nicest, smartest and the most knowledgeable people I have ever met. Use them.The job search curriculum seems to slightly drop in quality (Not the lectures on actual job search, those are great, but the organization and content of that part of the overall course). The intensity never drops and you are forced to be more independent in your work, though do note that this is by design. You still learn buttloads of good stuff, especially on how to actually get a job which is what everything led up to. Despite that it feels a bit lacking coming from the main curriculum.On a final note. There will always be times when you feel in over your head. There will always be times when you doubt your own ability.

I was waiting... Read More until I found a job before I wrote this review. To be transparent, App Academy offers a free sweatshirt for writing reviews, regardless of rating, but my intention here is to share my experience and honest opinions.Initially I applied to App Academy and Hack Reactor, as these appeared to be the top two bootcamps with the most rigorous admissions process. I ended up choosing App Academy because you learn two languages, Javascript and Ruby, and they offer tuition deferment. The curriculum is App Academy's best asset. I can attest that they teach Ruby, Rails, SQL, and React very thoroughly. They lay a strong foundational basis for Javascript, jQuery, HTML/CSS, and algorithms for you to improve upon later. And you will have to study some of these topics on your own to get to a level sufficient for employment, particularly when it comes to Javascript. Other positive points of the program include pair programming, supportive staff, smart cohort mates, etc. The staff for the most part consists of App Academy graduates, teaching and non. This is a double edged sword; on the one hand they know the curriculum very well, having gone through it themselves, but as most of them don't have industry experience, it becomes challenging when you have question beyond the scope of the curriculum. App Academy is also deeply committed to providing a safe, inclusive environment. They take violations of their code of conduct incredibly serious and as a female of color, I very much appreciated these efforts.The job search curriculum is not as strong as the academic portion, but it is a work in progress and constantly changing. I was expecting App Academy to have built connections with recruiters and companies over the past several years, but that was not the case. There is a small team called Talent Match that does focus on outreach to companies, but no one that I know in my cohort or previous cohorts has found work through them. You are pretty much on your own in terms of finding and securing work. App Academy provides resources and suggestions on where to look for work, how to write your resume and cover letter, how to network, what networking events are happening each week, interview practice, etc. but this information is also readily available on the internet. They do have a relatively good alumni network (that's how I ended up finding my job) but that is mostly dependent on the individual and how willing they are to help others. I'd like to see App Academy have hiring partners that recruit directly from App Academy graduates and continue building their alumni network.In the end, it took me three months to find a job, which is about average. For me, the job search was the hardest part. I had to do CONSIDERABLE additional learning on my own, with little App Academy structure and the entire reason I wanted to attend a bootcamp in the first was place was to have everything laid out for me. Recently App Academy added a job seeker program which was somewhat helpful in organizing my time and giving me some form of structure. From what I've seen, it's taking each cohort longer and longer to find work. Alums I spoke to from a couple years ago often found work within weeks. The first person from my cohort to find work took almost a month. This is no surprise considering the volume of students that App Academy and other bootcamps graduate every few weeks. The best piece of advice I can give here is to be prepared for that both financially and mentally. Also recognize that it really is a numbers game, the more jobs you apply to, the better your chances of an interview, and the more interviews, the better you get at them, the more likely you are to get an offer.To address and/or echo some of the comments/criticisms that have made here. Yes, the 13 weeks are extremely time intensive and you will probably feel burned out at the end (I know I did). You don't have much time to recover post program/pre applying to jobs, however, I did find the staff accommodating and reasonable like humans, not like corporate robots.

I'll address the negatives of the program... Read More before I delve into why I think it is a fantastic program that everyone should consider. The a/A lifestyle is not for everyone. Whether you are invited to Jumpstart, or make it through to receiving an offer, it becomes quite apparent that a/A does its best to recruit the best, brightest, and youngest to their program. Completing this program fortified my passion for coding. If you can't picture yourself coding from 9am-6pm (with a lovely 75 minute lunch) and then doing homework until 10 or 11PM every night, then you may want to reconsider. The material itself is not super, super dense, there's just an absolute ton that they shove at you in 8 weeks. In essence, be ready for your lifestyle to be a/A all the time. Myself, and a lot of my cohort mates would take Saturday off and play basketball Sunday mornings - so I want to be transparent when I say that although it consumes your entire life, there are patches of time to catch your breath. The range of students also varies considerably, but by the end of the program everyone is committed to finishing together. One fact that I heard a lot, yet still surprised me was how diverse the cohorts are. Keep in mind software engineering is some really hard stuff. Learning Javascript in one week is not for the weak, so it makes sense that a majority of attendees come from prestigious schools. If that makes you wary, don't be. We had students with backgrounds from MIT, Standford, Princeton, dozens of mechanical and electrical engineers, former employees at firms such as Google, Goldman Sachs, Mckinsey. But we also had multiple people who failed college, only attended community college, had never held a job more than 25k. I think youre starting to get the picture. The people that have a limited background in tech/engineering/coding do typically do better but that's true with most endeavors in life so I hope that doesn't deter anyone reading this. What's vitally more important is being flexible and having a lot of drive. There's not a person above 30 in our group, and it makes sense given that a lot of us dropped everything to come to a city with the highest rents in the country and a full-time curriculum to learn in a matter of months. It's overwhelming, and they specifically design it that way. Again, I want to repeat that because people will bash a/A for stopping to help them when they're struggling, or going too quickly through the material, but they design the course to make it feel like you're always inches away from drowning. They don't have time to make it easy because you're competing with unemployed young guns with a fancy CS degree and boatload of knowledge.Their contract sounds strict, but when it comes down to it they really want to help you find a job. If they had any loop holes they'd be exposed and taken advantage of. You can't offer someone a free curriculum without being sure that they will do everything they can to go out and get that job upon completion. Again, you have to be ready to work and that is even truer during the job search curriculum. It's also worth mentioning, because people read too many marketing materials and get a ridiculous thought in their heads, that they will make 100k in 12 weeks. There are probably 2-5 people in our graduating cohort (out of 70) that could obtain that. The majority of graduates take 90 days to find a job so take that into account as you're doing your preparation. A few parts of my a/A experience that I am forever grateful for are the relationships that you make and the material that you learn. It's actually pretty easy to show up to a place that day in and day out keeps trying throw more and more work on top of you. The biggest reason is because you develop extremely close relationships with a lot of people as you tackle trial and tribulations together. In the end, you enter the job market with a network of 1000+ a/A grads that know everything you went through. Don't underestimate the people in your cohort. A lot of us all came in with the same mentality of buckling down and getting the job. Like actual software development, you need to rely on your team in order to achieve.Every day is long and tiring. Every day will waver your self-confidence and raise your level of impostor syndrome to unprecedented heights. But every day is also extremely riveting and fulfilling. You will do and create things you wouldn't imagine. You find a way to get it done, and then you do it. That's engineering. That's innovation.Any questions, feel free to shoot me an e-mail. I was once in your shoes but somehow after twelve weeks of telling myself to take it one day at a time, I finally emerged as a software developer - and know that you can too.Read Less",app-academy

This may come as a surprise, but in the end benefits the student as they ALSO should want to find a job as soon as possible. Furthermore, the curriculum is only the barebones of what is expected of a constantly growing industry, and learning programs and technologies on the fly is essential to any software developer regardless of where they are at.

What I have come away with is a range of technical knowledge, a strong understanding of the social / collaborative aspects of web development, a work ethic I did not think I could achieve,... Read More and, maybe most importantly, a capacity to efficiently learn new technical material. The coding portion of the curriculum is difficult, but at the same time structured, well organized, and jam packed with intersting and relevant material. Some of the material is presented in a lecture format, but the bulk of the work is done pair-programming with fellow students. From day 1, this model fosters collaboration and encourages students to solve problems independently, instead of following along with examples. This being said, the instructors are encouraging, readily available, and all-in-all wonderful. Many of the instructors have gone through the bootcamp program as well, so they are knowledgeable in both the technical and social/stress-management aspects of the curriculum. While there are weekly assessments, the focus of the program is for you to learn as much as possible, not to transactionally complete assigned projects / homework assignments. In this way, students come away with not only the necessary skills, but also the drive, to start their own projects. Part of the coding curriculum involves completing three large projects, all of which you effectively design and plan yourself (with the support of instructors). These three projects become the focal point of your software portfolio, and are not something that other bootcamp grads can typically claim. Aside from portfolio building, the job-search part of the curriculum is packed with mock-interviews, networking workshops, and time with a personal career coach. Even post-graduation, App Academy leaves you with technical and networking resources, not to mention close connections to all of the other members of your cohort. The bottom line is this: App Academy is a serious time and energy commitment, but leaves you with a range of technical knowledge, an industry ready portfolio, strong technical interviewing skills, and a serious sense of personal pride for having made it through all of that in 13 weeks.Read Less",app-academy

Read More was not really going anywhere past simple games because I spent too long getting stuck, not knowing how and where to find help. After doing a little more research, I came across this bootcamp with its deferred tuition model which put me at ease in terms of getting students jobs. That and the stringent month-long admissions process which was already stretching me from a beginner-level (I had done a few projects in MATLAB and C++) and challenging my assumptions gave me an inkling that this might be the right place for me.Thankfully I was not proven wrong. The pace of the program is extremely fast, but with the benefit of being surrounded by students who are just as motivated as you. And when you get stuck the TAs in the room more than willing to help, which cuts down the learning time significantly of some of the more frustrating concepts (recursion was an early example for me). I did think at times though that there just weren't enough TAs around to help all of us; on some of the more difficult days we were waiting 20 minutes or more.Overall, I am confident that the fundamentals that App Academy taught me has prepared me well for the job search ahead.Some advice: -Don't be afraid to ask for help! Time is of the essence in a fast-paced course like this and there's no way anyone can 'get' everything that is taught in the 9 weeks as quickly as they would like. Some of the brightest classmates I knew did not hesitate to ask a TA within 10 minutes of being stuck. This is one of the biggest advantages of attending an in-person bootcamp so make use of it!-Live as close as you can to a/A during the 12 weeks. I consider myself one of the slower classmates when it comes to studying (when I see 30min reading it really means 1hr) and living 10 minutes away has saved me so many times from chopping the resource most essential to a bootcamper: sleep.-Find some way you can offer value and share it! I find that a large part of my motivation to learn about something really well is to be able to talk about it with someone later on. Our class has a Slack group where people would often share about cool things they implemented/learned and I always appreciated that.If you are willing to learn from and help others and are determined to do everything you can do deeply understand concepts, you WILL succeed.Read Less",app-academy

Read More app academy to having actual software development experience (rare). But I think it's safe to say for the majority of us, it took up all of our time during the week and (for me) weekends.2. How to succeed?Work hard. Come study in the office if you can, that way you can ask other people questions. Ask questions from TA's, your smarter cohort-mates, etc.. Ask questions.3. What are the students' backgrounds?Most people fall in between professionals looking for a career change, or people straight out of college who decided they didn't want anything to do with their major. Everyone who made it through are extremely hard-working and smart.4. What do you mean "made it through"?You can be dismissed by failing too many assessments. It does put a tremendous amount of stress on the students, however, I feel like I wouldn't have been as motivated as I was without the assessment stress. I do wish they would change the assessment structure to be more project-like though.5. Can I learn this stuff on my own? Aren't there tons of free material online for this?Extremely difficult, at least in this short amount of time. The free resources that I used seemed to go from doing for loops to "hey now go make a project". It's very easy to run into a bug or a question that you can't figure out when learning on your own. It's also very easy to give up. You won't have TA's to ask questions or give you feedback. When I was trying to learn this on my own, it was like running through a wall.

This was the real kicker, as App Academy's tuition model of paying a percentage of your first year's salary really gave me confidence that I would be supported and pushed throughout the job search process. I'm happy to say that really was exactly my experience. On my own, I never would have pushed myself to apply so quickly and to so many places, but with App Academy's support I ended up nabbing a Software Engineer position I am super excited about in almost exactly three months after starting to apply, which is the average time.

If you are not prepared for the first weeks it is nearly impossible to catch up and I would say most people who fail out do so because they were not sufficiently prepared.

The screening process was rigorous but humane, and they treat you like a valued individual (as opposed to another equivalent school that I got into... Read More where the interviewer was taking a Lyft or something while he was conducting my interview). The curriculum itself is really really well designed, not only building on itself to facilitate learning and deep comprehension, but is constantly being updated to incorporate the most highly demanded and up to date technologies. In my cohort they trained us to be strong React and ES6 developers, while not neglecting the older technologies, like jQuery. This turned out to be invaluable in the job hunt, since a lot of companies were looking for React developers when we graduated. I was skeptical at first about their emphasis of Ruby on Rails, since most companies seem to be moving away from that, but in retrospect, it really is the best way to learn about how a full stack application works, especially for people with less experience. And they do their best to give you a deep understanding of why things work the way they do so that those skills are transferrable. The program also gives you a good foundation in algorithms, web and backend architecture, and interviewing skills. I was just amazed at the amount of knowledge I had gained after the 13 week program. I received 5 job offers within 3 weeks of graduating, one of which I ended up accepting, and I'm very excited to be formally starting my software engineering career. However...there are a few caveats.First, new students should know that you don’t magically get all these skills just because you get into the program. I found myself frustrated by a few of my peers who seemed more focused on socializing and just getting by in the assessments than studying and finishing all the projects and assignments. Because a lot of the learning happens in pairs, a weaker partner will compromise the learning opportunities of others. It also risks the reputation of the program as a whole. However, this was more the exception than the rule. Most students worked hard, demonstrated a real passion for programming, and took what a/A taught as a foundation for more self-directed learning, and in doing so became good developers that can build almost anything. Second, just being a strong developer doesn’t guarantee you a job interview. Especially in a market weary of bootcampers. That part relies on a lot of networking and luck and doing extra side projects. So the job search is a demoralizing, grueling process to get your foot in the door. Once you get your technical or onsite, though, you’ll find that App Academy has prepared you well. Pros: - well-designed curriculum that builds incrementally on learning- teaches the most up-to-date technologies/libraries/frameworks- good balance of lectures, hands-on projects, videos, take-home assignments- reasonable hours for a bootcamp (9am-6pm, + 2-3 hours of homework) - gives a good foundation in algorithms, web architecture, and other skills necessary for interviews- based on pair programming and collaborative skills- good job search guidance for how to craft your resume, frame your past experiences, etc. - deferred tuition model reflects how much the program is invested in making you a good, employable developer- progressive values and mindset, encourages diversity and inclusiveness for all backgroundsCons: - bootcamps in general have a bad rap these days, so it seems to be a more challenging than before for grads get interviews - less rigorous screening and assessments process for students may hurt reputation in the long run- didn’t feel particularly close to my cohort or staff, but like I mentioned, that was less of a priority for me- growing student numbers might compromise quality of training in the future - some TA’s are less knowledgeable than others, but you’ll always get the help and guidance you need- there’s now more structure and support during the job search process than previous cohorts, but it’s still not enough- paying back a large percentage of salary can end up being more than other schools’ tuition if you end up getting a really good offer.

It eases up later in the program as the chances of getting kicked out diminish significantly.* Inconsistencies in curriculum.

Read More since you are reading this review, you are thinking the same thing. Once I decided that I was invested in making this transition, and a bootcamp was the best way for me to make the change, I began to compare various programs and the main thing that differed App Academy from the others was their payment plan. Due to the time requirements for all these programs (80+ hours a week) it is pretty unrealistic to expect to keep any resemblance of a job/income and living in NYC without one is pretty tough to do. App Academy helps remedy this by not requiring any payment (other than a security deposit) until you land that first job. Not only did this make living in an expensive city with no job more do-able but also gives them a "horse in the race” when you start your job hunt. This includes continuous interview prep of white boarding, alumni Q&amp;A, review/critique of your portfolio (resume, cover letter, GitHub/coding projects, personal website, and LinkedIn profile) as well as an in-house job fair at the end of your cohort.Regarding the curriculum I found that while interviewing, most companies are not looking for you to know a certain stack but have the ability to learn a new stack (if needed) based on what you already know. Most bootcamps offer a full stack curriculum in order to give you the needed marketable skills to prove you confidently know what you should and that you can learn something new if needed, and App Academy is no different. When I attended, the stack was Ruby, Ruby on Rails, SQL, Javascript, Backbone.js, jQuery, HTML, and CSS and since then they have updated to React.js instead of Backbone.js, but don’t worry, all new material is available to you as alumni so that you can use it if you would like to learn a new framework. Like anything you do, you will get what you put in and App Academy gives you everything you need in order to succeed and become qualified in all the topics you cover. From day one you will need to properly prepare for the interview process where you will complete online exams, a live coding challenge, and a live interview; and the testing doesn't end there. To make sure that everyone is where they need to be so that no student is disadvantaged while pair programming there are (bi)-weekly exams that you must pass in order to continue with the program. Preparing for this will include hours of studying and practice on the weekends and after class… this will definitely be 80+ hours a week. All of this is not to discourage you because if you really expect to become proficient in so many languages in such a short amount of time, this is the only way to do it. If you are ready to put in the time for 4 months and 100% sold on becoming a developer I think that App Academy will be perfect for you.TL:DR - App Academy offers a comparable stack/curriculum to other bootcamps with everything you need to succeed if you are really 100% committed to the program. It WILL be 80+ hours a week to get by and pass their weekly progress exams and 100+ if you want to really excel at everything. That being said, I would not be at my current company without it and the payment plan they offer allowed me to even think this transition would be possible.Read Less",app-academy

I did a lot of research and applied to many of the major boot camps offering 'similar' curriculums. I was accepted to a few including Dev Bootcamp and Flatiron School. All of the boot camps say that their curriculum is geared towards people with "no experience", so anyone can do it. That's a bit misleading as they all will expect you to demonstrate some logical competency and a basic understanding of how to problem solve programmatically in the interview. I spent about 6 months practicing on sites like codeschool.com and codewars.com before I began applying. In the end, I selected a/A for two reasons: their tuition structure (pay after you get a job), and because I found their application process to be the most difficult. I applied 3 times before I was accepted to a/A, vs. my first try at the other schools.During:My brother is a Marine and had a great time ribbing me about going to a 'boot camp' for obvious reasons. But I have to say, although there are not pushups, calling it a boot camp isn't far off. It is very, very hard, and the hours are long. Again, I never graduated college, so my basis for comparison might be skewed, but even people in my cohort with degrees ranging from BAs to PhDs acknowledged that it was a difficult program. The style of teaching at a/A is to show you a thing once, then give you instructions and a day to replicate it with a partner, with the TAs on hand to assist. They will not give you direct answers (for the most part) but rather guide you through the all-important process of debugging and figuring out problems on your own. It's challenging, and at times very frustrating, but ultimately the system teaches you how to be a self-reliant developer.After:In 5 months I went from being a bartender with no college degree to a well-paid full-stack (actual job title, not just a buzz word) web developer at a company that I'm very excited about. Most graduates (so far, from my class) landed an initial salary between 90 and 100k. Another concern I had going in was that a/A teaches Ruby on Rails, which some developers will tell you isn't the most relevant language these days. That's BS. Developers love to be opinionated about the tech that they work with, and you will be too eventually. I love Rails, but I can say objectively that it's more about learning how a server is structured than the specific syntax you are using. The knowledge that I got from a/A felt tech agnostic by the time I reached the job hunt; language is a nonissue. Anyways, there are definitely a lot of Rails specific developer positions out there if that's the route you decide to go. The job hunt is a bit intense, but there are designated a/A staff members to help you along the way. If you follow their road map, keep studying after graduation, and utilize your peer support network, you will find a job in under 3 months.

The peer interaction is one of the best parts of the program, you can easily learn as much if not more from your peers as you will from the lectures and reading. The BEST and most unique part of app academy is the tuition model (no tuition until you find a job, at which you pay a % of your first year salary over time) . This is crucial and something you can not find in any other boot camp that I have ever come across. The fact that they do not get paid until you find a job means that your incentives are aligned with theirs.

The program is far from perfect. It's growing faster than it can adapt, leading to problems:1) Instructor quality varies. There are great lecturers (some of whom have already left since my relatively recent graduation), and there are mediocre lecturers. There are also just straight bad lecturers.1a) If you rely completely on lecture to learn and understand the material, you're doomed anyways. That's not the point of a bootcamp.2) Project quality varies. Some of them were honestly mind-blowing. Like, whoa...that's how that works, holy shit, I get it-type projects. Some of them are filler (learning how to do authentication 4 times is an example of teaching to a test, which in a short curriculum, is probably not the best use of time).3) TAs are usually high-performing students. That's good, if you want to learn from people who graduated shortly before you. It's good for the ratio, but they aren't always able to help you.4) Job search curriculum makes up 3 weeks of the total 12. In some ways, it was really helpful: whiteboarding, working on projects, and dedicated application time were all helpful! Fuzzy "you can do it!" lectures, ghostly "job seeker counselors" that were frequently out and less frequently helpful (though encouraging, which is fine), and a general head-in-the-sand approach to the glut of junior (and specifically bootcamp grad) developers out there were all kinda downers, considering this was a quarter of the total course. Increasing the required application # from 100 to 200 is not a good strategy to combat a rapidly saturating market.BUT - to bring it back to where I started: it does work. You just have to be aware of the limitations of the program so you can make up for them with your personal efforts. Self-teach extensively before considering a bootcamp.

Read More of the concept and are more willing to take a chance on you than if you have no coding-related experiences on your resume.Pros:- Instructors/curriculum: The quality of instruction was really high. The readings were up-to-date and very clearly written/easy to read. The assignments were challenging and effective at getting you to understand more thoroughly what you were introduced to via the readings. The instructor is basically the bulk of what you're paying for -- they are generally great at debugging your code and some are very good at explaining complex concepts. I think it would've taken me many more months to learn the same materials on my own by digging through resources on the internet. - Peers: You'd be surrounded by peers who are smart and passionate about tech. I definitely learned a lot by pairing with different people and picking up their good habits. It's also a network that you can hang on to after graduation.Cons:- Job assistance: This was the weakest part of the program when I attended. I think the job curriculum (how to write resumes, how to interview, build your portfolio, network, etc.) was much less structured and more under-staffed than the coding part of the program. I believe this has changed since my cohort (they hired more people and tweaked the curriculum) but I can't comment on how well that's going. There's also ongoing efforts to create a network of alumni, which I think will be the most helpful for future job applicants.Read Less",app-academy

I had picked up programming as a hobby and found that I really enjoyed it, but I had no idea how to turn it into a job. Around that time, programming "bootcamps" entered... Read More my radar, seemingly presenting a viable means to make the switch. After some research, I decided a/A was the one for me, largely due to the pricing structure and an excellent review from a friend of a friend that had recently attended. Let me go off on a tangent here and rave about the pricing structure. If you're not aware, App Academy charges nothing up front (although there is a deposit). You don't pay anything until you get a job and then once you do get a job, you pay a percentage of your salary. This unique model is incredibly fair, allows someone like myself who couldn't afford other bootcamps to attend, and says a lot about what a/A offers. With this model, a/A would completely fail if what they were offering was anything less than high quality.The application process was very challenging and took a bit longer than I expected. The process includes interviews and several coding challenges but you are not penalized for the time it takes to get through it all. a/A even provides a whole bunch of rich materials that, with enough review and practice, should be sufficient enough for one to get through the challenges. This says a lot about a/A's integrity and accessibility. a/A has high acceptance standards, but if you are willing to put in the work there's a good chance you'll get in, and a/A wants to help you be successful in doing so. In fact, I didn't pass the last coding challenge, but since I was close to a solution I was given more material to go through and a second chance.a/A kicked off at full speed. I was expecting the program to be challenging and a whole lot of work, and I experienced exactly that. Days typically consisted of a "lecture" in the early morning led by the instructors where we went over the previous days assignments, went through demos, had a Q&amp;A etc. Then we jumped into the days assignments which would take up most of the rest of the afternoon and often the evening. Most days we pair programmed, which was much more fun (and less lonely) than my programming journey had been up until this point. Seeing others' approaches to problems was also very insightful. At night we were expected to go over the solutions to the days problems and do the reading for the following day. We had nearly weekly programming assessments that were often very difficult, primarily due to not being able to use any resources. I hated the assessments due to the stress they brought me, but they did force us to develop a deep understanding of key concepts. However, even with regular stresses and working upwards of 100 hours a week, my time at a/A was very enjoyable. The instructors were incredible resources (I wish I took more advantage of this) and I made a ton of great friends. I have no shortage of fond memories from this period of my life and I was pretty bummed to see it end.I can't recommend App Academy enough. I had a great time, the program is of the highest quality, and I couldn't be happier with the results I got. 3 months at App Academy (plus a few months in preparation) got me into a career that I'm very happy to be in and my income has doubled. How can you beat that? Also, 6 months after completion my debt to a/A was completely fulfilled. I graduated from college six years ago and I don't even want to get into how much of that student debt remains. If you're seriously interested in programming as a profession, make a/A your first consideration.Read Less",app-academy

My cohort was exceptional -- I had less programming experience than many of my peers, but the curriculum moves so fast that students of all backgrounds were constantly challenged and engaged. Sometimes the speed and quantity of assessments felt overwhelming, but it is necessary if you want to learn something as complex as the fundamentals of web development in such a short period of time. I'm sure everyone reading this has looked at app academy's website and read other reviews, so I won't get into the hiring stats, salaries, etc., other than to say that my cohort's experience with the job hunt certainly lived up to all of the advertising. Instead, I want to focus on something that I didn't expect before joining app academy, and that is the culture of instruction. App Academy promotes itself as a rigorous program with great stats, but doesn't necessarily advertise culture, and this made me nervous going into the program (I really liked some other bootcamps' focus on culture). I was extremely happily surprised when I joined app academy -- even if the focus on promoting a positive culture isn't part of the brand, the instructors at app academy did an incredible job fostering positive conversation, promoting inclusiveness during a stressful period, and I can see that they've continued to hire some of the brightest and most empathetic communicators from succeeding cohorts. This was hugely important, but many of the reviews that I read before joining app academy just focused on the challenge and the job hunt. The instructors are top notch developers and generally great individuals.Even though I was coming into app academy from a grad school, I was continually amazed at the pace and rigor of the learning experience.

I now work at an awesome company working on really cool problems as a full stack engineer.My background: I had taken a... Read More couple of college C.S. classes and I had a degree in analytic philosophy. I'd done codeacademy and tried a couple small projects, but I was having trouble making the leap to employment-level skills.The structure and content of the App Acadaemy curriculum is top notch. They know exactly what is useful and what is not. For example - not useful: rote memorization of code. Useful: learning how to think logically, approach problems with the intention of creating an elegant algorithm, and how to read documentation and quickly pick up new skills. That being said, the tools you learn are also really useful tools to know how to use: they focus on ruby/rails, sql/active record, and javascript/react (when I took the course, it was backbone).The quality of instruction is incredibly high, and you spend most of your time (probably 80% of the day) actually coding and working on problems. I really liked that, as I definitely learn better by doing, and most of the best learning moments were working with TA's who could explain a concept in practice after getting stuck on a specific part of a problem.After the course, they have good resources to help you apply and interview for positions. It's still a lot of work, but it's really valuable to hear what actually matters on a resume or cover letter, what interviewers are actually looking for, etc.I now work at a really cool company, working on stuff way more interesting than anywhere else I've ever worked, and getting paid like 3x more than I was at my old job. I'm using the ruby/rails and js I learned at App Academy, but I'm also using React on the front end, as well as Scala/C++ on the backend. So don't let anyone tell you that you're only qualified in the language you know.Two quick caveats: 1) This is not a place for people who want to figure out if they'll enjoy software engineering. You have to be committed and ready to work really hard from the beginning. 2) This is not a place for people who have trouble self-motivating. 80-90 hours per week is not a joke, and a lot of that is forcing yourself to work through really complicated readings and problems. After graduating, you won't be handed a job, but you'll have the skills to get a great job if you work hard and keep practicing. But if you're likely to burn out easily or need someone else to push, maybe this isn't the best place for you.tl;dr:Great program that will teach you the skills and mindset to be a software engineer anywhere if you're already motivated and willing to work for it.Read Less",app-academy

My journey shortly ended after the second basic coding challenge. This sort of gives you a picture of how much coding experience I had going into the Prep course(not enough). My results after finishing the month long prep course changed a lot of things for me. Not only was I applying to other bootcamps I was getting into all of them. I got accepted into all of the bootcamps I applied to, and I applied to all of the hard ones including the notoriously competitive App Academy and Hack Reactor. The details of the course can be found on their website so I won't go into that here. The reason I say this course is all about you is because you have one month to get into the bootcamp of your dreams, put your all into it. If you're looking for a bootcamp prep course, I am assuming you already am ready to commit some 3 months of your life to flip it upside down. The same idea applies to this course, you have 1 month to make those 3 months a reality. Those 3 months bootcamps that you dreamt of, you can have your pick of the litter and make it your reality. There were three students that stood out to me in the course, myself included. One thing we had in common was that we did not have other time commitments. This does not mean you need to drop everything just yet. The course I took was part time accessible for a reason. The curriculum covered everything I was being tested on and more. As long as you grasp concepts and can write code accordingly, you will be in great shape. I assume the tests will only get harder as the years go by but I know App Academy is an adaptive school and I wouldn't be surprised if they adapt their curriculum as the times change. The "Job Support" is what I consider to be their application support. Coming out of this prep course you apply to bootcamps, not jobs, but I consider this to be the equivalent. It was good. There were extra materials to work on and mock interviews to be scheduled.I can't vouch for any other bootcamp prep courses. Even if the curriculum is the same, the experience could be completely different. I went to App Academy's Bootcamp Prep Course and I hit the jackpot. Things click for me. I'm not a wiz, remember I failed after the second basic coding challenge, never mind the technical interview, but after the course I killed it all.I'm confident that this course can do a lot for a lot of other people.

It was nice that I was able to go at my own pace and learn what I wanted to, but after some time, I knew that I wanted to accelerate my learning and find a position...

After completing the technical interview with App Academy, I was accepted into the March cohort. I completed the 4 week prep work that was required prior to starting, and went in enthusiastic and ready to learn. For me, the course was a load of fun. From Monday - Friday, from 9 - 6 (with a 1 hour 15 minute lunch break and a 15 minute break), it was all about learning and coding. My personal schedule was to wake up at 6:00 AM, get to App Academy by 7:30 - 8:00 AM, and review the readings / homework assignment before class started at 9:00. After 6:00, I would look over the solution for the day's work, and prepare for the next day. I would usually go to bed by 10:30 PM, with the latest being 11:00 PM, as I believed getting enough sleep was the key to me being able to focus throughout the immense workload that App Academy entails. However, everyone in my cohort was different, so what worked for me might not have worked for someone else. Finding the balance and schedule that worked for me was key to keeping my momentum going and not get burnt out. The good news is, it was only for 3 months, so even though it was tough every day, it didn't continue for years. I did enjoy learning and coding constantly, and it was amazing how much I learned at the end of the curriculum, with a full-stack project that I am pretty damn proud of. I would actually look forward to Mondays, as it was another day to continue to grow my skill set and build cool things. The most stressful part was probably the assessments. The policy at App Academy is that you are only allowed to fail 1 out of the 6 given. If you fail two, you are released from the program. That's why it is important to keep on top of the material, and make sure you have a deep understanding of the concepts that are taught. They do provide practice assessments that closely follow the actual assessment, though they are different, so you can't just memorize the practice assessment. It is highly recommended that you take the month-long prep work that is given before the start of the main course seriously, as everything from the curriculum builds on top of it.The part I enjoyed least was the job searching process. While App Academy does provide lectures about algorithms for technical interview questions, I found it very difficult to get through the resume screening to even get a chance for a phone screen. My other classmates had more success than me though, so I might have just been an unusual case. They tell you it's a numbers game, and that you have to apply to many to get a few hits. It was tiring and demoralizing, but I eventually got through it and landed a job. I would recommend saving enough money to last you not only the 3 months of the main curriculum, but also for the job search process as well, as the amount of time it takes to find a job is uncertain. Overall, I really enjoyed my experience at App Academy. You are surrounded by motivated and talented individuals, and everyone is working together to get through it. You are challenged to learn a crap load of information everyday, and you will be amazed at what you can achieve in a short amount of time. Without App Academy, I would not have been confident to even apply to software engineering jobs.Read Less",app-academy

(I used Windows.) However, FYI most coding bootcamps require a Mac for their full stack web development courses. (2) You might be wondering, why does the prep course teach JavaScript? That's because most bootcamps let (or require) you to interview in JavaScript. (3) The course has an online discussion forum, set up via a website called Piazza. Since the course itself runs in parallel with the bootcamp prep courses in other areas, you can ask for help from other bootcamp prep instructors and students from across the nation. (The course was only set up in SF and NY when I took it, but it now seems like more locations have opened.) (4) If you're taking this course to get into App Academy's full stack web development course, you get to skip the pre-challenge and move straight to a 45-min technical interview.Overall, the bootcamp prep course is a big investment, but it will increase your chances of getting in a top bootcamp.

Read More very experienced programmers teaching, etc. I'll focus comments on what I differs from the norm in AA. Most of these differences are observed second-hand, through interviewing candidates from other bootcamps for the place I work now.ProsAA spends time developing algorithmic thinking. We started off barely knowing enough Ruby to run nested for loops to solve 'Fizz Buzz'. In the next 5 days we implemented a lot of things like binary search and quick sort. At the end of the first week, we built Tic Tac Toe allowing human players to play through the terminal against an unbeatable AI in 8 hours (that was nuts!). A few weeks later we took 5 days to learn all the same things in Javascript. Many of the junior programmers I've interviewed from other camps knew a lot of ways to do things with Rails, but didn't know how to script well enough in plain old Ruby/JS.AA taught object-oriented and social programming. Our code was constantly evaluated for object-oriented thinking, clarity in choice of variable and function names, and accessibility to other programmers. Really handy now when I'm working with 6 other engineers!AA taught away the magic. AA's instructors taught this super well - nothing is magical. In the course we did things like rebuild Active Record through meta programming, recreate the basics of Backbone.js using plain Javascript, implement our own sessions/login before using Devise/Sorcery, read server logs to detect and get rid of N+1 queries, and other things that dig deeper into frameworks that many take for granted.They know what companies are looking for. I was fortunate enough to get 5 offers in 4 weeks of searching after AA. They really prepared me for the job search.ConsAA's curriculum covers less overall material. I think the course was a little too light on coverage of CSS. We also didn't cover some classic Rails patterns, like making forms work through AJAX with Rails' forms using remote: true ( we did cover how to AJAXify through plain old JS, obviously). Finally, I wish we had spent more time learning to code through TDD. It's a tradeoff for focusing more deeply.AA is extremely fast-paced. You have to work hard to keep up. Definitely reminded me of 'drinking from the firehose' in my MIT days. Your brain will hurt a lot. You will stress over keeping up and doing the homework after coding for 10 hours straight. But, in the end, it's all worth it.Don't hesitate in contacting them. Kush and Ned are super nice :)Read Less",app-academy

Read More of graduation and I'm still working there now (I'm loving it!). The bet paid off.AA was the most intense experience I've ever had. I came in with limited RoR/JS knowledge and I learned a ton over the course of the program. I personally liked the fact that several students had more experience than I did. Although at times discouraging, it ultimately motivated me to push hard; I was determined to not fall behind. It blew my mind that by the end of the ninth week I could build a web-app front-to-back. For real.Not everyone makes it though. I've personally been told there have been scenarios where students were refunded their deposit in unfortunate scenarios. Ned and the staff give more attention to the people who seem to need it. It's pretty clear they want everyone to succeed, it seems genuine too, regardless of their financial incentives.It amazes me how after the program I am able to have high-bandwidth conversations with experienced engineers. Although we learned Rails, I'm currently writing a web-app for work in Flask (Python micro-framework). Picking it up was chill because I understood fundamental web and MVC concepts. More importantly, I learned "how to learn." The skills you gain from AA go beyond Rails/JS, you gain a skill-set to become a real programmer.AA was an experience I will never forget. I worked my ass off, met a lot of motivated people, and got my dream job working as a professional programmer. Best luck to anyone considering the program or going through it right now -- just remember to get enough sleep!Read Less",app-academy

I was recommended by one of my Ph.D. student friends, who eventually successfully... Read More landed a good working position. I therefore decided to follow his footsteps.Overall: I am quite satisfied with Springboard's program. I think it has formed me well to become a data scientist and to quickly land a job. However, I believe there are a few things they can still improve on.Pros:- Overall Quality: the data science track definitely introduces and educates you well to the data science world, used in the industry. It covers most aspects of data science (wrangling, visualization, ML, ... ) and lets you acquire enough experience to land a job in that field. Of course, it won't replace extensive years of professional experience, but it is great way to bootstrap your data science career.- Preparedness: I would argue that the data science track doesn't require advanced programming skills, but it is best to have some Python experience (the software overwhelmingly used in the course). If you don't (like me), the first few months can be a bit of a learning curve. You eventually pass that stage though.- The Capstone Projects: the program is focused on two data science projects that you lead from start to finish. A great learning experience where you put your hands in the dirt, which you accomplish under the supervision of your mentor. These are great accomplishments you put in your portfolio and that you showcase to employers. - Mentorship: Speaking of which, the supervision by your mentor is probably the greatest feature of the course (and why the price is a bit high). For those who need someone to look over their shoulder, it's definitely a great resource that helps you move forward in the course. The mentorship I received was great and from what I heard, bad experience with mentors is quite rare. Plus you can always change, if it gets really bad.- Career: The career services they offer are equally useful. By helping you build your résumé, your LinkedIn profile, etc... Springboard helps you reach out and makes your profile more attractive to employers. The mock interviews you need to pass in order to complete the course are ideal reflections of real career situations.- Flexibility: While it is not something obvious when you start, you can actually ask for pauses, freezes and extensions if you need more time to complete the curriculum, or if you dealing with too much stuff a time in your professional / personal life (I assume they don't openly advertise that because they prefer you to finish the certification in a reasonable amount of time). I personally extensively used those (mostly because of how busy I was with my Ph.D. work, specially when it came down to my thesis defense). I eventually completed the program in 12 months. However, I DO NOT recommend to do so within such a big time frame. 6-8 months is definitely reasonable if you allocate the proper time each week. If you trail like I did, Springboard eventually starts charging you for additional extensions.Cons:- Rates: their rates are a bit high in my opinion and I believe it's mostly because of the number of resources they offer (mentors, career advisors, extensive curriculum, access to external resources like DataCamp). It's good to have that many resources, but in my opinion, some parts of the curriculum (maybe less than 10%) are useless or redundant. Therefore, I think the rates (assuming you avoid enrolling in paid extensions) could be 10% cheaper than what they currently are.- Customer Service: this definitely has been the worst part of the whole program. I assume it's because Springboard has considerably increased its volume of students (across all tracks) but their personnel's size hasn't keep up with the trend. While I always eventually obtained the information I requested, it takes a while to find and reach out to the proper person. First of, they only allow email communications. Then, their services are split between advisors, support team, finance team, etc... So if you ask for something to someone, they will most likely re-direct you to someone else. And the response time can be a few days. I don't expect every customer rep. to know everything and I assume it takes a while to train, but it is quite frustrating when you can't get a straight answer immediately, specially for finance-related questions or for deadlines (when you need an answer fast).Read Less",springboard

Read More I could not have learned what I did in this course without his help) - Additional mentor calls if necessary (these aren't with your mentor, but with a different mentor assigned by Springboard. I still found them helpful) - The structure of the course helps you really understand the basics and have a good foundation for the fundamentals of UX design - The Industry Design Project! Huge strong point. This will give you real-world experience which you can put on your resume and highlight on your portfolio - If you take the job guarantee, you're required to pass mock interviews at the end of the course: whiteboarding, portfolio walkthrough, and a behavioral interview. You get two chances to pass, but I passed them all on my first try and so did the other students I spoke with. As long as you prepare and practice you should be able to pass, but this is a strong point because it prepares you for the real-world interview process. I was really nervous for these but I'm very glad they're embedded into the structure of the course - I have just applied to complete with Springboard, so I haven't begun my job search yet, but if you take the job guarantee you will also have access to career coaches 6 months post-graduation, which will be incredibly valuable - My student advisor (Molly) was incredible - quick response from her when I reached out, and she went above and beyond to address my concerns and make sure I was taken care of Sticking points (for me personally): - The course ran a lot longer than I expected it to. The projected time to complete is within 6 months if you spend 20-25 hours a week on the course. It took me about 11 months to complete, and I think this is more due to the course structure than anything else. Projects build on other projects, so sometimes I had to revise certain projects before moving onto the next stage. For the lengthier projects, I had to revise multiple times and it took a few weeks to get the go ahead from my mentor to continue. Like I said, he was incredibly helpful to me outside of the normal hours we met and I don't blame him for this at all - I think it made me a much better designer and helped me to go into the material in more depth. My sticking point here is just wishing that Springboard projected closer to a year rather than 6 months (for part-time students like me), but this could be something that's unique to my experience - I understand why the career coaching sections are built into the structure of the course, but I have to admit I really did just want to focus on the hard skills of the course and found it a little jarring that there were career coaching sections in the beginning/middle of the course rather than just the end. The reason for this is networking and building up your LinkedIn profile/connections during the course, so the reasoning is good. I just struggled with feeling like I really wanted to focus on the skills themselves before doing the networking Overall, I had a really positive experience with Springboard and found that they were really helpful and responsive when I needed them to be. I haven't started my job search, but if I'm able to update this review later, I will when I have a better understanding of how that will look.

There are small projects sprinkled throughout to help build your understanding and comfort with the content.

He was always engaged during our weekly meetings, and was very open to offering me advice outside of that time via fast email response. The mentorship is by far the highlight of the course, and got me excited to continue on with the Career Track.Overall, I'd recommend this course to anyone with a limited coding background considering doing a bootcamp, as it gives you those basic tools to pass the technical skills assessment and gives you the confidence to endure a 6 month bootcamp.

Because of COVID, all courses were enrolling online anyways, so that made my decision a bit easier.Overall, I thought that the Springboard experience was outstanding: quality curriculum; supportive and highly responsive network of mentors, coaches and advisors; ability to move at your own pace (for me: fast). I loved that the curriculum not only covered practical UX skills, but also included career-building units to help you network and improve your resume, so you're ready to apply to jobs right after you complete the course. I had a wonderful mentor who shared his real-world UX expertise during our weekly meetings, and if I ever had a question or issue, the student advisor for my cohort was always available to help. I also loved my career coach calls--valuable time with actual recruiters in the industry who help you navigate the job search from updating your LinkedIn to salary negotiation. After I completed the portfolio unit, I immediately got traction in my job search. I presented projects from my Springboard coursework during the interviews, and felt comfortable talking about UX principles with my interviewers, based on what I had learned in the course. I ultimately accepted a senior-level role before the course ended, which was my "above and beyond" goal going into the program. I would definitely recommend Springboard to anyone interested in pivoting to a career in UX (Design, Writing, Research, etc).

267786,Anonymous,1,NULL,2020,1,"Software Engineer","Big Oof",8/24/2020,2020-08-24,"Software Engineering Career Track",2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,"I have been enrolled at Springboard since April of 2020. I took their Software Engineering Career Track Prep course in order to get a strong basis for the main course. This course had a lot of good coverage on introductory subjects like standard CSS,... Read More Javascript, and HTML. I have taken a number of college courses on these subjects beforehand and didn't struggle with the prep material at all. I also really enjoyed the teacher: Colt Steele. You can Google his name and get a nice summary of his accomplishments with Rithm School (in-person Bootcamp in San Francisco). My issues with the program started around Section 12-13. While the earlier sections are easy enough to understand, that almost everyone won't struggle with them, once you get into more complex topics....the issues with Springboard become more glaring. Colt does a great job at breaking down subjects in the videos and keeps things interesting with fun jokes and a lighthearted approach to learning Web Development. The real issues seem to be with the supporting material and structure that Springboard itself provides. You meet with a "mentor" once a week for 30 minutes where you can't really accomplish all that much besides discuss a few issues you are currently having with your code. I actually like my mentor a lot, but they aren't supposed to be there to support you constantly as you work through the various projects\assignments. Instead, you are asked to reach out to the TA's, which Springboard states are available via chat and email throughout the day. This is a lie. There are really only 1-2 actual TA's that respond via email and on my experience the chat option is really only available around 5% of the time. So after you type up the issue you are experiencing, you just wait for a response, whether you needed a quick 5 word reply on something, or an extremely complex explanation with multiple paragraphs, it can take anywhere from 20 minutes to 3 hours to get a response. There are no 1 on 1 virtual sessions where a TA would join a Zoom call and work with you individually to track down issues. Instead you upload code to Google Drive and wait for them to download and par-ruse your uploaded code. Also the sections are setup in a really weird fashion. You are expected to watch 10+ videos all at once per section (each ranging from 5-20 minutes), and then work through exercises at the end, which could cover something you learned in the second video over 2 hours previously. Instead of re-enforcing important subjects along the way (and no, coding along with Colt does not count as exercises Springboard :) ). It ends up being extremely hard for individuals to have a feeling of cohesiveness between the instructional videos and actual assignments. It comes across as lazy and unconventional for a school you are spending $8,000-$12,000 to attend. My wife attended Flatiron and I recommend that bootcamp far above Springboard (as far as web development is concerned, I know they are solid on the data science front from what I have read). Pros:-Colt Steele is a really good teacher, but can move a bit fast for some I imagine. -Material is presented with very modern tools, frameworks, and methodologies. -Fully online so you can "do it from anywhere" -Online Slack community of other students, though it isn't very active. Cons: -Extreme lack of assistance when working on larger projects\assessments. Just wait till you get to the Hack and Snooze app...oof. -TA's are basically non-existent. -Office hours are usually clogged with 20-30 students that are all working on completely different parts of the curriculum and getting questions in for your specific needs is near impossible. -Coding along with Colt during lessons is not good enough for reinforcement of complex topics. -Career Prep is essentially updating LinkedIn, Attending virtual events, and updating your resume. -No Pair Programming :( -Springboard just telling you to "check the solution" for answers. Giving me the answers, and helping me understand concepts are not the same thing. -Doesn't require enough GIT push\pulls to make your profile look more active to employers. -Basically completely self driven, which I know works for others, but not for me as I really enjoy structure. -Changed their "job guarantee" mid curriculum -Very little feedback from the maintainers of the curriculum as to why they are choosing to do certain things over others. If you are searching for an fully online Software Development, I sincerely recommend looking elsewhere (Flatiron is the only other school I can speak on personally as my wife attended). I have worked in a separate section of Information Technology for nearly a decade and I struggled a lot to use their learning materials. And for perspective, I have 4 year IT degree, and 10+ IT Certifications in infrastructure. TLDR:Steer clear of Springboard unless it is for their Data Science Career Track. Their Software Engineering course is very new and needs a lot of work with supplemental activities to bring it up to par with both their other offerings, and other offerings available at other bootcamps.Read Less",springboard

It's a very competitive market, I'll be the first to be straight with you about it. It's a bit like being both a businessman and an artist. We are here, mainly, to solve problems. They come in all varieties... Read More such as socio-economic issues, app functionality, matters of convenience and satisfaction, and visual aesthetics. It's hard to be good at them all. The UX career track at Springboard will give you your fair share of experience in each until you come to understand what it is about UX that you are best at. For me, it's research and strategy. I can hold my own all the way through the design process, but I find the most joy thinking about the why's, and bringing insights into design. I like to solve problems on a systemic level.As for the course, it's a highly sufficient curriculum that has enabled me to feel confident as I continue to learn design. The program has well vetted UX mentors that are industry veterans and are quite successful. And, the team of career coaches I've interacted with has been top quality. These people are true professionals and THEIR job is to get YOU a job. That's a promise.But, it's still all on you. Make no mistake. A career transition isn't for the feint of heart, especially design. The good thing is that we are makers, so you should never stop making something. Never stop learning, and be courageous. And, be prepared to work for free or below your 'paygrade' (at first).I am currently working on various passion projects that I will add to my portfolio in addition to the three projects I completed through the Springboard curriculum. Be mindful, you who are reading this, that UX isn't something you stop learning. I know there is a lot of information out there, though, and it can be overwhelming. Springboard was a great pathway for me to understand UX in principle and in process. But, don't stop with what they give you or it won't be enough. With that foundation of knowledge and experience, I've been able to further investigate principles I enjoy, and find methods that fit my needs and specific style. Springboard teaches design thinking, but there are other umbrellas of UX understanding such as CX and User-centered design, which Springboard introduces briefly.Being a problem solver, I revolve around the core of UX, which is finding pain points. I've also incorporated a problem solving framework called customer jobs aka jobs to be done. I'm also investigating systems thinking and system's diagramming to use in tandem. These are just examples of many different UX frameworks you can add to your metaphorical toolbelt. Just find what you gravitate to. It's equally important to spend time designing and working with others. Other designers are your allies, but don't get too caught up in trying to be everyone's friend. Building meaningful relationships means being professional first. Add value to get value. Be genuine and authentic, seriously. Just be you.Being you is very important because design interviews are really hard. You have to be tenacious the same as any jobsearch, but you are going to basically be auditioning many times during interview rounds. Jobs will want to see how you design and how you will work with their team. So, prepare well for the mock interviews, which are effectively the finals for the UX course, or you won't get the job guarantee that comes with the course, and you may not even get a job even after all that. But, without risk there is no reward. And, so long as you put 100% into your projects, you will be a confident enough designer to showcase your work in an interview.I found a home in design because of Springboard. I truly believe that. My first love is writing, and always will be. But, I couldn't pass up the opportunity to be a problem solver by trade. I used Springboard to get an idea I had off the ground, and I'm so glad I did. It's the right place for me. I like making things and solving problems.Read Less",springboard

The entire team at Springboard India, from executive and management to placements and instructors, have absolutely no idea what's going on, and as long as they're getting your money by selling you on the hope of a new career, they don't care. My experience with this bootcamp can be summed up as follows: Attending Springboard india data science track was the single most disastrous professional and financial decision I've ever made. For months prior to making the decision to attend a bootcamp, I spent time doing my due diligence and actually spoke with grads and the placements team before applying, and I was assured that job prospects were "good" and that "industry relationships" were abundant. This was the sole reason I was willing to pay an exorbitant fee for a skill I could have learned from books and videos online, however by all appearances myself and my entire class have been misled. Remember, for every good review you see on here, there is a bias because students are threatened with retribution for criticism or bad reviews. For every bad review you see on here, there are probably a dozen other students who feel similarly but are unable to say so because they're desperate for any help after spending 6 months and 1.95lakh on a program. Personally, I've been struggling for more than a reasonable interval to find consistent, well-paying work. The time and finacial investment required and subsequent failure to find work ended a long term relationship. Maintaining a flexible schedule for interviews that never seem to happen means I can't find consistent, steady-paying work in other fields. My advice to those of you who are considering a switch to a programming vocation: buy some books (Big Nerd Ranch et al.), watch videos (UDEMY, TeamTreeHouse, etc), and develop your own projects instead of making the mistake I made by trusting the paid representatives of a bootcamp. I can say whole-heartedly that this program should be avoided - save yourself the money! Please do not attend this bootcamp. I'm giving a fair warning to anyone who is thinking about attending. Do your research and you can see this is a very flawed curriculum, Reader should keep in mind that most graduates don't want to leave negative reviews about the bootcamp they attended because they are still relying on the bootcamp to help them find employment. It's twisted. You can't find much credible negative information online regarding bootcamps. Find a few graduates of *the* program you're considering taking at the bootcamp you want to attend, email them or find them on LinkedIn, and ask them lots of questions. This is how you will get an honest review.Read Less",springboard

About 75 % of the Q &amp; A's I registered for were cancelled, no reason was given. The curriculum is outdated and old it is a lot of reading and more reading. The mentors are not experienced at all. They just come to collect a paycheck and update their skills on the expense of the students. The school does not monitor the mentor sessions or the Q &amp; A sessions which are just a waste of time. The slack channel your questions will go unanswered or if they answer it they will shame you and point you to an article on how to ask questions. I was not a professional programmer I was a student looking to learn. This program is not designed for students to be successful. Not a single assignment was graded or was any feedback given. Save yourself the time and money go buy the same course on udemy for $10 bucks. Employers do not look at education they look what can you build. The stuff learned here I was not even able to get a UNPAID internship. spring board is one of the most expensive bootcamps out there. And naturally, I thought it would be one of the best out there. It also had so many good reviews. Now, I think they remove all the bad reviews and just keep the good ones. It is definitely not worth the money they ask. The curriculum is not that great and teachers are fine but pacing is just awful. Also, I can not stress this enough. You can not, You can not learn programming and become developer in few weeks. If you put effort and time, you can get same resources provided by springboard all over internet. Do not go here.Read Less",springboard

The curriculum is littered with mini-projects for students to practice their new skills further. The best part of the program for me was probably the mentor experience. The weekly meetings are opportunities to not just review your capstone projects, but to learn how to think like a professional. If you ever feel like you need more time to discuss something (and those half hour sessions can feel short), most mentors are available for messaging or possibly even extra sessions. One thing I really liked about the program was the heavy focus on building essential non-technical skills, like networking or storytelling. Thanks to the course material and the career coaches, by graduation, I really felt like I was ready to enter the job market.Here are some changes to the curriculum I would recommend:- Make mini-project reviews more important. While I talked to my mentor about some of them, I never saw a single review in writing. I think this would be a great opportunity to discuss theory and practice code reviews.- Course material needs to be expanded in some key areas.  -Deployment was limited to one Github mini-project and a very high-level overview video. Graduating students should probably have some familiarity with Docker or other software for productionization. - Distributed computing was covered in just two sets of exercises. I'd prefer if there were not just more material on the subject, but some more discussion of the underlying theory. - While this may have been a result of me taking the "generalist" track, I felt the material on deep learning was way too light. We were given only one optional exercise that worked with Keras, despite it being the easiest major DL framework to learn and the least likely to be implemented at scale. Even some more optional reading material would have been nice.

Read More no shores.It has been more than a year when they have started functioning in India with a new batch coming in every month. They threw every heavy word to make us see Gold everywhere when there was only rustic iron. A hope brimmed among Data Science aspirants that (as springboard was saying we were among 20% aspirants they selected) we were going to be successful. Even I was told that they will focus more on us as I was among the initial batches. (Note: They didn't even took a puzzle test that they put up on website. They even lied that my prep course will start immediately just for me to make the payment and then no response for few days. Their marketing guy says any lie he/she can to make you sign up.)At first the course seemed good. Many of us were blinded by the shine Springboard was manufacturing. But mist started to clear after a month. It was all curated content from the internet which was not made clear from the start. I let it go. Their main USP was weekly half hour call with the mentor. Here it comes to Luck which mentor a student get. They didn't had much mentors here to use algorithm to match with mentee, so they just matched as they hired a mentor with no particular reason that why we were matched with that expert. The mentor is someone who has Industry experience yet how can they impart such knowledge in half hour in week. Even if they can guide us, are they really prepared for it or going with the flow? Did Springboard gave any training how their course structure is or what they require from mentor to do for mentee? A Big No. It seemed every mentor was handling their mentee as they could. As feedback from many fellow students, some turned out good and some not so. Thus for many it felt like a gamble of a very large amount. Due to ambition of becoming data scientist and already taking the decision, I moved on.Now we cannot ask every question in half hour with the mentor. So we have Teaching Assistant. They had one who recently graduated from a prestigious engineering college in India. After some of my interaction, my concern was that he was not a good fit for this role as he doesn't have any teaching experience, smart doesn't mean you have the ability to teach or help someone. Many of my questions to him came back to me as another question. Mostly why do you wanna know or in which part of course this question refers too, when the answer could be simple. I raised my concern but in vain. I simply stopped asking questions but googling it myself thus spending more time for answers. Also, their office hours seemed more of a formality.Then there was student advisor who interacts with students and solve their concerns. At start she seemed good, listening to the concerns and trying to solve them. But there were very few students, as the numbers began to increase every month, her response time increased further to a point when it took a month and a half for the my certificate to rectify. But the course went on.There were many parts in the course which seemed very distracted from the course. The difficulty level of a part was sometimes low and then jumped high as we were doing a doctorate on that particular topic. The main part which was Machine learning felt like a game walkthrough than we actually playing the game. Few parts were rushed and few repetitive. But I did not complain, even to myself and used search engine.(Note: According to them we can find everything on the internet so learn to use it.) Their cost was not justified yet I did not squeal.The point where came the breaking point, is their Career services. They give 100% Job Guarantee but all I can see is throwing someone in a deep sea after showing them a video of someone swimming and then asking for the person to swim. I think they are giving this guarantee considering the demand in market and effort by an educated and employed student themselves. It worked in USA but it failed miserably in India. It was all due to lack of vision and effort by the management. The management felt immature, incompetent at first. Then at the course end the management felt even more immature and more incompetent. They did not consider the feedback regarding course being not suited for Indian Market and did not update it. They did not consider so many students who were unsatisfied with the career services. Their career calls ran in a loop and as a pre-recorded tape convincing us that they are working on helping us. This convincing started to feel like manipulation when after 5 months and multiple calls even with career services leads ( Yes lead(s), as their lead changed within a year. Might be fed up with overall management itself), I felt I was where I started from. It seemed they didn't even knew what they were doing. It was at the point when their marketing part was working very very hard to get more numbers in. It was a memorable journey which I wish to forget. If anyone wants to feel the same, then please join Springboard India and I assure you it will be a bumpy ride with a big black hole at the end.Read Less",springboard

They don’t care about the understanding level of students.Support team: There are only two teaching assistants assigned to help all of the Springboard DSC students in India.

Nobody validates the projects/assignments which will be submitted to Springboard as part of their curriculum. There will be no feedback on the projects done.Finally the Springboard management team, they will be calling continuously until you pay the fee, once the fee is paid.

Springboard course have no original content : Entire curriculum... Read More of DS career track comprises of haphazard external links from Youtube , Datacamp, khanAcademy and many others. They have simply fooled the students by compiling various mediocre level videos from sources which are either free to access (like KhanAcademy, Youtube) or available at a very less cost for yearly subscription (like DataCamp) . These courses from external sources accounts for majority of the portion of springboard curriculum while only the introductory videos (about 5 minutes) are from springboard.Major Point to be learned : Any budding Data Scientist enthusiast can himself club such resources with a much lesser cost than springboard. The course has repetitive datacamp courses which doesn't explains any concepts, only giving an illusion of learning by giving fill in the blanks type exercises comprising of python and its packages syntaxes memorization.2. Mentorship is a Joke:Springboard courses are backed by its so called 'mentor-ship program', in which a student is promised to be guided by an "industry expert" on a weekly basis for half an hour. In these sessions, it was promised that weekly assessments by mentor will take place which will help in crossing any hurdles during the course and in making some "out of the world" DS project which will eventually land the student in some fairyland DS Job. Truth &amp; my experience: The course curriculum itself wasn't known properly by the mentor assigned to me. Many times my mentor either asked for postponement of my calls, or took the calls more casually. He wasn't able to help in any way when I was stuck in the curriculum and informed that the curriculum is very inferior and substandard compared to any other courses I have seen. I noticed form the start that the curriculum isn't helping to learn any concept or algorithm and conveyed the same to mentor (It wasn't of any help) . HE simply told to go ahead and trust the course, which eventually led more time wastage and frustration. After a while he didn't even bother to contact me as he already recieved his fees from springboard I guess.3. Teaching assistant, Career Coach - another big liesTA is promised to clear your doubts. However, TAs simply post google search results which I myself could do. Career coaching sessions : This was the biggest fraud of all. These coaches are for helping you polish your linkedin profile and apply cosmetics to your profiles, projects so that they seem enticing to hiring industries. Note this : They aren't teaching anything job/knowledge worthy and want you to fool other people into hiring you (like they have fooled us into taking the course by simply re-packaging Datacamp &amp; Youtube videos under springboard hood)4. Most of the students enrolling in this course aren't able to complete the course because of the poor content of the course, zero help from TAs &amp; Mentor. Even after completing also, this course doesn't teaches anything beyond some python syntax and won't even help in landing even an entry level job anywhere.5. Job Guarantee is another false promise made by springboard people. They don't help in this aspect. A student is supposed to find or attract companies by his own knowledge gained by completing this course (which is irrelevant and insufficient at the least to say)6. Office Hours : Another trickery to make students enroll in the course.They have another concept called Office Hours in which some existing DS working in another big company is supposed to take a class. It happens almost once or twice a month. However, these office hours are of no use to a learning person as they don't teach anything except doing abstract talking about many vague concepts and we are supposed to be amazed at how awesome job is to be a DS.The Best Part of all : After coming to my senses, when I asked for a refund and informed that the curriculum offered is not was I was expecting for my hard earned money and is below average, Springboard people have informed that I have used most of their resources (Youtube and Datacamp) and it isn't possible to give a refund. They aren't even worried about your money, your career or your skill enhancement, once they get their fees.Moral of the story in a line : I wanted to give a zero star rating, however minimum possible is one. Please don't waste your hard earned money on this course.Read Less",springboard

In terms of curriculum, I overall enjoyed Springboard’s curriculum and learned a lot. The Harvard lectures... Read More are very informative and good for understanding machine learning theory. I do feel that their SQL curriculum is not very strong and could be improved, my SQL skills were poor when I finished the bootcamp. I also feel like there should be more information about basic Python coding - I had coding interviews that I was not prepared for. The two capstone projects are definitely the strongest aspect of Springboard and the aspect that got me the furthest in the interview process. Having projects to talk about really helped me in my initial interviews. My mentor who helped me with my projects was really nice and helpful! One thing that is a little sketchy that you should be aware of before you join: as part of the job guarantee, you are required to pass several mock interviews, and you only get two chances to pass each one. This did not impact me, but it is not something that is disclosed before you start the bootcamp. I was pretty satisfied with Springboard’s curriculum, but what I was completely unprepared for was the competitiveness of the job market. It’s tough to get interviews with no experience, and when you do get interviews, you have to be perfect or they will just find someone more qualified than you. I struggled with technical interviews, particularly coding interviews and business interviews (business is not my background). The mentors that they have to help you prepare for technical interviews are not super helpful. The job guarantee makes it so that they have a reason to help you get a job, but I honestly didn’t find them that helpful - my career coach was nice and was good emotional support but didn’t help me get referrals and didn’t help me with technical interviews. Part of the issue is that I feel like there’s only so much they can do - the data science interview process is really like the Wild West, every company does the interview process differently and it’s tough to prepare. It felt like every company was looking for something different and it was impossible to be prepared for everything because there is just so much to know. About four months into my job search process the pandemic hit, and Springboard made a couple of major improvements to the job search program. The most important improvement they made is they created a Placements team that spend their time specifically looking for referrals and “ins” at companies for you. This was extremely helpful for me, and though the job I accepted was one that I found on my own and got through networking on my own, I got a few good referrals from this team. The second major improvement that they made was getting new mentors to help you with technical interviews. I got a job soon after I started speaking with my mentor, but I felt like he was very good and better than the mentor I had worked with in the past. Overall, a mixed experience with Springboard. I appreciate that they have the job guarantee program because they do try to help you, but I wish there had been more help sooner and not just because of the pandemic.Read Less",springboard

I had done prepwork with two other online companies; Thinkful and Galvanize. I looked into other online bootcamps by those two and also General Assembly. Further I highly considered joining the in person Galvanize bootcamp in Denver, including visiting them for a tour. Why choose Springboard? To drive and hour into a city, Denver, 5 days a week for 13 weeks was a big stressor on top of the curriculum for Galvanize. I looked into living there in the city, which is not my comfort zone and very expensive! Thinkful seemed to be extremely similar to Springboard, and General Assembly too. All had requirements of living within an hour of particular major cities. I ultimately landed on Springboard midsummer because they listed both Denver and Detroit as their major cities for required money back guarantees and opportunities. Further, it offered a Data Science Prep course that would then take the tuition paid and put it toward your tuition for the main Data Science Program.

My student adviser provided great support along the way when I needed it.Negatives:-	Job SupportSpringboard is by no means a silver bullet to a dream data science job, but it’s close. You have to put in the work to landing a job to get that job afterwards. I found there were times where the career coaches were booked months in advance, but they seemed to have hired new staff. I have no doubt if you complete the course in six months that you would be ready for a DS role, but it’s an intense six months.- Completion TimeI took much longer than expected and was given extensions to finish. This was more a human error than a Springboard error, and if I felt mentally the way I do now compared to when I started Springboard, I could have easily finished in the allotted time. Just be careful with grandiose capstone projects.- FeedbackOutside of my mentor, I found feedback tough to get when handing in coursework. Overall: Great experience, would do again. The positives are fixable and far outweigh the negatives and I found it paid for itself in salary raises, even with the extensions.

Most people I know also put in this much time, not just me.• Weekly mentor calls are short and therefore rushed. Mentors don't have time to review your work before you submit it. Yes, you technically have "unlimited" mentor calls, but those are with a different mentor who is not up to speed on your project, and they are also limited to 30 minutes. Hour-long calls would have been sufficient.• If you do not have a background in visual design, you may struggle with this program as there is little training in visual design, however, I know Springboard now has a UX/UI career track, which I'd recommend if you need help with visual design. • They do not help with job placement, but do provide career coaching for 6 months after you're done the program.Read Less",springboard

The curriculum delves very little into cloud services (AWS, GCP, Azure), preferring a more open-source based model. I think this is good in general, but machine learning engineers are inevitably going to be using one of these services in their careers. The course gives you credits for AWS, but little attention is paid in the curriculum to its use cases.

Techniques other than machine learning. It's kind of ironic to ask a course like this to do something other than ML, but knowing when ML is useful and when other techniques are appropriate (from heuristics to Deep RL) does not really get much attention.3. More work on data collection. It would be much more helpful if the course explained more further up the pipeline on how to collect, ETL, and store data to make ML possible.

My professional background is in higher education. I recently completed a PhD in philosophy and have experience teaching undergraduate philosophy courses.... Read More I have minimal background in math beyond the high school level, but my philosophy degrees have prepared me for the sort of technical and critical thinking skills used in data science. I'm doing the Springboard program to make a career change. I completed most of Springboard's Data Science Prep Course, which I found helpful, before being accepted into the Career Track program.Review: Overall, my experience in the Career Track program has been pretty good so far. My impression is that the quality of one's experience with the program depends largely on the quality of one's mentor. My mentor was initially pretty poor, and I had a difficult time understanding his accent. But I reached out to Springboard early in the program, and they helped reassign me to a new mentor. Thankfully, my new mentor is excellent and has dramatically improved my experience. I'm in a study group with other students, and I've gotten the impression that their mentors are so-so. I have learned a lot so far in the program, and I've been especially happy with Springboard's "customer support" (very friendly and helpful) and career support (they get you started on job stuff early on in the program). A fair portion of the data science curriculum (so far) has consisted of Datacamp exercises. Springboard partners with Datacamp, and students get free access to Datacamp courses. Honestly, I haven't been that impressed with the Datacamp courses. They are helpful for gaining superficial exposure to tools and skills used in data science, but they don't cultivate a deep understanding. I will say that the time estimates Springboard gives (completion in 6 months, working 15-20 hrs a week) are pretty unrealistic. Most of my study group (including me) is working on the course full time, and we are all on track to finish in 5 months (at the earliest), and probably more like 6 months. Unless you already have significant data science experience, don't expect to finish the program in under 5 months, and possibly even under 6 months.Overall, given my experience so far, I would probably recommend (pretty highly) Springboard's program to people (depending on their circumstances). I'm happy to discuss my experience with people if anyone would like to know more, especially people with an academic background in the humanities. You can find me on LinkedIn and around the web if you look (e.g. philpeople.org). Feel free to reach out.Read Less",springboard

You'll also be paired with a mentor and it's a coin toss on whether or not you'll get a good one. With that being said, the program is flexible and the Springboard staff is dedicated to helping you work through your schedule. If you end up with a mentor who isn't helpful, make the effort to communicate issues and give it a fair chance. If the issues continue, talk to your student advisor and he/she will pair you up with a different mentor. I've personally experienced this and was later paired with an incredible mentor. My student advisor was also incredibly compassionate, kind, and helpful during my Springboard journey. I would say, in general, the whole staff from operations, mentorship, and career services were amazing. I was debating between this program and others, but I am grateful that I chose Springboard. The way I see it, there will be difficulties and hardships in any program. What's really important are the people behind the program and whether or not they'll support you throughout your journey.

Other bootcamps charge $10,000+ for coursework that teaches the same principles over the same length of time. Additionally, springboard comes with a straight-forward job guarantee. The quality of the course material is repellent. I’m an avid learner and have taken many online courses through community colleges and state colleges. The amount of knowledge you gain and support you get from springboard makes universities look slow, petty, wasteful, unresourceful, and greedy. Much of the course material is drawn from online sources, but this is now common practice in higher academia. The coursework is highly informative and of sound quality (rivaling and surpassing the quality of a HCI course I took at PSU for example). What’s more, at the end of the career track you will also have a portfolio and a website platform to showcase all your work - critiqued by senior designer to make sure it looks right. And a CV and cover letter that is evaluated by those same designers. You also get a weekly one-on-one mentor throughout the length of the course. My mentor, Ciarda, tailored every session to my needs, was efficient beyond compare, and was always accessible. You can also schedule help from additional mentors whenever you need. Finally, the administration of springboard is flexible, personable, and does right by its students. I had the intention to complete the 6-month track within 3-months (I was on the month-to-month payment option so this would make the course $2,000 less for me). There were a few set-backs that pushed me a couple days past this deadline. The career track manager, Dave, very kindly worked with me through the obstacles to make sure everything worked out fairly. Going into it, I was worried a bootcamp might just be another form of degree-mill. The company isn’t about extorting students for money, but really wants to empower students to and earn a good name doing so. Way to go! I’ll likely be coming back for the AI/Machine Learning track once I get my Python up to speed. :)Read Less",springboard

I also loved the professional research presentation and portfolio walkthrough—I was matched with some amazing UX professionals who gave me invaluable feedback and assured me of my talent and abilities. The only con I can really think of is that the course is essentially designed in a linear fashion and students often do not look through future units when they're working on something already. However, with the industry project and several presentations and mock interviews in the latter part of the course, time allocation and planning can become tricky if students want to finish the course in a certain time frame (for me, it was 4 months) and didn't plan ahead enough.

I was putting in about twice as many hours as it was saying the average student puts it, because I was behind on my understanding and knowledge base.

Speaking of tools, they grant you access to paid tools which you'll use throughout the entire course. You will develop REAL content (landing pages, blog content etc.)and launch REAL campaigns (PPC and Social). You'll run REAL A/B tests for web optimization. The SEO curriculum played a HUGE role in securing my current job. The course also comes with a one-on-one mentorship involving weekly Skype sessions with a subject matter expert in Digital Marketing who tracks your progress. A major attraction for me was their Google non-profit partnership which enables you work with a REAL non-profit to manage a $10,000 Google ad grant! These and several other projects you'll work on will form your portfolio at the end of the program.The online community was also very interactive. Catherine Leipold was such an agel! Awesome student relations and always quick to respond to queries. Calvin Nisbet was my career coach, another great guy who gave me tips which proved quite useful in my job search.Will I recommend Springboard?? Hell yeah!

Read More be the quickest and efficient means to get into a new industry. Now that I'm done, I believe this was one of the wisest decisions I've made. What I liked the most about SB is that it is designed to be very resource-conscious, and even though they are an online program, you actually get a lot of one-to-one/real-life interaction. They are genuinely invested in your learning and success, and everyone I've engaged with through the SB network—from the administrative staff to mentors to fellow coursemates—are really smart and supportive individuals. You don't get the impression that they are just "running a business" or scheming to milk your every dime. The entire experience was very human.The curriculum is also very thoughtfully designed. Even though at first I thought the idea of "curated content" rather than "original content" may be a downside, I have come to appreciate it. Because we are reading materials written by multiple people on similar subject matters, I have a better feel of the overall disciplinary discussions out there, and I feel like the knowledge is something I could confidently fall back on.Even though this is an online/remote program, I am glad to see that over time SB is investing in more in-person activities and interactions, such as onsite community events. One of the three projects we had to complete was an industry design project (IDP) where we get paired with a start-up to do real client work. My student advisor, Dave Weiner (Hi Dave...), thoughtfully paired me up with a company that works with education, since I came from academia myself. The office of the start-up was also located really close to where I live, so I actually got to visit the office and meet the team in real life. Because of this human thoughtfulness, the whole internship experience unfolded much more smoothly and successfully, and in the end, I got hired back as full-time staff without having to go through endless rounds of resume (re)writing, etc.The fact that the industry project turned into a real full-time position really helped me get the foot in the door (which is the hardest step really), so I don't take it lightly. But even without that luck, I do believe that in the current product job market, having real work experience is more important than learning of any shape and form, so having the IDP as one of the units was a huge advantage. Hopefully, SB will continue to invest in the IDP/internship program and expand their professional network, so that more students can continue to benefit.Read Less",springboard

The course in combination with the articles taught me how to explain my work and discuss the typical UX design process, since I had experience with that through the course.I was interview around 4 times, with different members of the team/recruiters which included an in person interview and I also had to do a design challenge which I was very nervous about but I took everything I learned so far in Springboard and applied it to the challenge. I'm happy to share that I got the job and have working there for 3 months (since January), but I decided to still continue with Springboard and I completed the course the end of February 2019.I would definitely recommend Springboard to those who already have a design background and are looking to gain more experience in the research aspect of UX Design. Even those who have a research background such as Psychologists, Communication/Marketing (I have a BA in Communication) majors will also find the course helpful if they're looking to transition into UX, however, the UI Design section isn't as thorough in this course like in the UX Career Track, as this course is only 3-4 months long.If you're looking for a course that goes more in depth when it comes to UI design, the UX Design Career Track for Springboard might be a better option. That course is 6 months long with career coaching and a job guarantee, but the application process is much more extensive and the price is higher. You also have to have a previous design background to gain entry into that course so the UX Design course that I took might get your foot in the door.Overall, I'm grateful for Springboard and all they have to offer. I highly recommend them!Note: The course I took was originally a Skills Track called UX Design when I was enrolled, but it's now called UX Essentials.Read Less",springboard

Read More to me for a few reasons. 1) my current position has always been a hybrid design/front-end coding and i wanted to be able to create more effective designs backed by user data 2) my company had started to explore the UX space and toy with installing a process and team and 3) this course also comes with a mentor that can help you through the course materials and project.the course materials are sourced from many different sites and while i thought this strange at first, i felt that it really added something extra to the course. first and foremost, it resulted in a large list of resources in the way of design and UX websites, blogs, organizations and tutorial sites that i now had in my back pocket and could continue to use for years to come (not to mention you still have access to all the course materials after completion). the other thing i found that i liked about this was that everything was not in the same voice, so you tend to get different perspectives on processes and techniques. that along with the fact that i felt the course dove deep enough into each discipline to get one’s feet wet made this a very valuable course IMO.to top it all off, Springboard as a part of the UX course matches each student with an experienced UX professional. each week you meet (online) with this mentor and review all the knowledge you are soaking up and discuss to make sure you’re understanding how all the pieces fit together. my mentor had years of contract experience working for companies like PayPal, Apple and Cisco, so she had a wealth of first-hand experience and knowledge to share with me and helped me to understand the application of all that i was learning. this feature alone was worth the price of admission for me.the one drawback i would take from this course could also be turned into a positive depending on your availability and drive. this course is a “work at your own pace” situation, so if you are overly busy (like i was) or just not motivated enough, the course can drag on and get expensive (you are charged monthly in some cases). that being said, another good part of having the mentor is that they help to keep you on track so if you are ready to make your way through the course, you should be fine!Read Less",springboard

The strongest aspect of the course are the mentors providing weekly coaching. I had three mentors throughout my Springboard courses, two of which had experience in the game development industry, which was important to me. One of my mentors did not have much experience in the industry and as a result I requested a change in mentors. This was the only negative experience I had with the course, and resulted in some duplicated work when I transitioned to my next mentor. Even though this mentor did not have game development experience, they had plenty of Fortune 500 UX knowledge and if my desired job was not so niche, I believe the mentor relationship would have been excellent. The curriculum has a relatively short beginner's guide to UX concepts before introducing the capstone project. The capstone will take up most of your time, and all of the small assignments build to this final project. I felt like the training content (largely through Lynda videos) was applicable and engaging. It helped to apply the ideas from the video directly to my project as I took notes. Having a capstone to constantly build on while studying these concepts provided constant motivation. My mentor also helped take concepts and apply them to my project. I found it easy to speed through sections I was already well versed in, and enjoyed being able to take my time in sections that were new to me. Something they don't mention in the on-boarding/ marketing material is that you also get a year's Lynda.com subscription with your Springboard course. This is a great resource to access if you have other disciplines you want to study.Overall, I'd recommend this program with the caveat that if your mentor doesn't feel right for you in your gut don't feel afraid to contact Springboard support immediately and talk it out with them.

Read More to enter this field once I graduated. However, by sheer luck, I stumbled upon Springboard's online UX course and signed up. At the time, I hardly had any little knowledge of what UX was at all. Now, as a UX Designer at IBM, I cannot stress how pivotal this course in enabling me to jumpstart my career.Springboard uses an intuitive website to guide students through the various stages of designing a mobile application or website (which may conveniently enough be used as a portfolio piece). Utilizing a mixture of articles, interactive courses, and videos, I was able to gain a firm understanding of the different design research methodologies popular in the field. This was important on two fronts. Firstly, these techniques helped me design better applications, since tools like card sorts, interviews, and wireframings genuinely help you design better experiences and can be applied virtually anywhere. Secondly, the techniques I learnt served as buzzwords to those I interviewed with for UX Design roles that demonstrated my knowledge in the field.On top of this, there were two aspects that made this course truly successful. The first was the weekly Skype calls with a design mentor. At the start of the course, I was assigned a mentor who was a professional in the field. Once a week I could consult her with any questions about the coursework, or any career-related questions I had. Cultivating this relationship humanized the course for me, and transformed it from a collection of videos and literature to a full-fledged course. The second aspects that stood out to me was the price. At 400 dollars a month, you really can't complain given the material you're given. I was able to go on to develop 4 portfolio pieces with other clients after the course to build my name- other popular alternatives such as General Assembly will run you thousands of dollars more.Overall, would definitely recommend this course!Read Less",springboard

BACKGROUND: Graduated with a master's in one of the biosciences, few months prior to bootcamp. Due to my work, already had background in data analysis, stats, and programming... Read More in another language besides Python. Some Python tutorials were sufficient for applying to this bootcamp. CURRICULUM: Covers required basics, esp for data science interviews. Mostly based on pre-existing materials online, but Springboard does the legwork of sifting through the overwhelming sea of Internet resources and curating them into a chronological curriculum. Additionally, they’ve got their own resources, including lists of interview questions and networking how-to’s. These were immensely helpful. I also used the interview questions as a study guide, which paid off as several topics appeared in actual interviews. STAFF/MENTOR: Lots of support – you can schedule calls with a career coach, do mock interviews, and generally interact with other people in what could otherwise be an isolated journey of self-teaching. Incredibly professional and knowledgeable staff, very responsive customer support. I was also very happy with my mentor. The first one I was assigned to was a bit lackluster, but after having to postpone my start date, I ended up with another one. My weekly call with him helped me stay on track, and he was incredibly helpful and encouraging. This included post-bootcamp, when I sought his advice on choosing between jobs.CAPSTONE PROJECTS: Critical part of my resume, since I didn’t have industry experience or data sci projects where I used machine learning. Starting a project can be intimidating and unfamiliar, so the bootcamp provided me structure. Another Springboard staff member grades your project and provides feedback - I wish their comments/suggestions were more detailed though. COST: Steeper than I’d liked, but it paid off. I had the freedom to pursue this full-time, so I did the per-monthly plan hoping I’d complete it within 2-3 months. I ended up taking 4 months, but still avoided the heftier 6-month charge.JOB HUNT: Again, YMMV – like I suspect w/ many bootcamps out there. It’ll be up to you to do a lot of the networking. I reviewed my Springboard curriculum, plus lots of extra reading outside the curriculum (particularly practice tech &amp; behavioral questions). Also deployed one of my Springboard projects as a Flask web app. I went to events/Meetups, did informational phone calls w/ close and distant contacts, and applied to several jobs (requiring cover letters) each week. Overall: Good self-paced curriculum that covers the basics. Pricey, YMMV, but worth it for me ultimately. I found a job 2 months after completing the bootcamp, but a lot of the post-bootcamp work was on me to apply, network, etc. Happy with my mentor and interactions with staff.Read Less",springboard

It's just articles and videos online curated by the staff and I honestly didn't feel I was "learning" much from them.- The course I took was online, so if you don't put in time and work, you won't get anywhere and waste $$.Overall:I think with the Springboard UX Design course, you get what you put in. If you are determined to build a great portfolio and get things done on your own, this will help you grasp the concepts and push something out so you can interview. If you need someone to babysit you and teach you things page by page, this is not for you. Don't take this course expecting them to set you up with a job or anything.

Read More course from Springboard. Have tried using many MOOC`s (massive online open courseware) to learn data science but to no use. Springboard`s mentor driven and community driven coursework is a lot better. Setting up the R Studio environment, Github, writing code on R, R markdown etc, all take quite some effort, if you are from a non computer science background (I am not a CS major but had some coding in high school and undergrad). This is where the mentor and community are most useful. The $ 500 per month fee is very reasonable for the community, mentor interactions and curriculum that you get in the course. My advice to prospective students who have no background in statistics and programming is as follows:1) First learn statistics from online resources like Khan Academy, Saylor.org etc. Topics may include descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, types of distributions, probability), inferential statistics (p-value, Z-scores, hypothesis test, t-test) and machine learning (linear regression, logistic regression, some simple classification algorithms etc). Even datacamp.com has many good coding courses built around statistics. 2) Learn some R, Python and SQL from datacamp.com. Take a total of 10 certificate courses from datacamp in these 3 programming languages. This will really help develop your coding skills. In R, take introduction to R, intermediate R, dplyr, ggplot, statistics with R etc. In Python, learn numpy, pandas, seaborn etc. 3) After you have finished above 2 points, you can move to Springboard. You may think that Springboard is also about the first 2 points. Yes, it is. But the most important part of Springboard is the capstone project. Once you have completed point 1 and 2, you can enter the Springboard foundations course confidently and spend most of your time thinking and working on your capstone project. Remember that nothing matches the skills you develop while completing an end to end capstone project. This is only possible on Springboard at a very reasonable price.Lots of effort and motivation + Springboard + Datacamp is the best formula for becoming a quantitative analyst/junior data scientist, if you do not already have a background in statistics and computer science.Read Less",springboard

The course itself is quite thorough in a lot of ways. I have a graphic design background, but you really don't need any background to go through it. Since I had read some books, did some reading online and took a few high-level UX courses, it was a bit easier at the start for me than maybe it would be for others. I enjoyed the set your own pace aspect and devoted 4-5 hours a day toward it, but it could easily be worked on part-time and be effective. I do think that the more immersed in the hands-on work you get, the better understanding you'll have. I found the projects and the mentor sessions to be arguably more valuable than some of the articles and videos you watch, but it's partially because I learn better by doing than observing. Overall, I really enjoyed the learning and came out of the course with a good portfolio piece as well as a solid understanding of how to do UX generally. I didn't utilize the job search assistance because I was able to get another graphic design job before I finished the course. I think if you go through the course you might be able to get an entry-level UX job if you did a solid job of thinking about your portfolio as you went through the course, otherwise, expect some work at the end to make your work presentable to prospective employers. I suggest Springboard for anyone who likes to get through a bootcamp fairly quickly and in the comfort of your own home.Read Less",springboard

I really miss my mentor!I came to Springboard with no coding background , but with a graduate degree and some knowledge of statistics. Springboard does not make ANY of their own curriculum and they don't craft any tie-ins or connections between the different lessons. A large part of the curriculum is based off of Data Camp to learn R. Learning through Data Camp has it's own set of challenges and none of these are addressed by Springboard. Other components of the course include the EdX Analytics series and dplyr videos through Data School. Many of these resources are good on their own, but none is complete enough to give the student (or at least one w/o a coding background) sufficient foundation to tackle the assignments. Often the assignments are so disconnected from the curriculum, that they are difficult to complete w/o help for your mentor--which is OK to a degree, but given that each mentor session is 30 minutes--often time runs out before addressing the capstone and other project concerns. I really feel that more attention should be paid to the curriculum---it is certainly OK to use resources from other sites, but there should be reinforcement of key concepts like..writing functions...through either supplemental videos created by Springboard, or focus lessons during the office hours.With regard to job assistance--there is none and the career materials provided, again are brief You Tube video clips or books that are not presented in any kind of way to give the student a view of the field, options for careers or even guidance in terms of moving forward with skills, once one completes the course. In fact, after completing the course, there is zero follow up or transition. I never received any certificate or any kind of "next steps if you want to keep learning" email.

I recommend this course to those who are new to UX or those who are looking to solidify their skills and break into the field.Read Less",springboard

My last several jobs I had were Graphic Designer positions with some Email Marketing(basic HTML coding) experience.... Read More I had been looking into the UX field but as a father of two, it's a little hard to make time for learning and getting into a brand new career. Well, I finally got my chance after being laid off from my previous employer and knew I had to do something to get into a different field. I had looked at another 3 month intensive course in NYC, but that would have taken me away from my family and also costed much more (about $9k and not including rent). So I figured I'd give Springboard a try. They have a free course that includes videos from online that is curated by seasoned UX Designer. The paid version, you get a mentor paired with you for 30 min weekly calls and also to ask questions and review your projects. They have many mentors from different backgrounds and from different geographical locations. I personally wanted someone who had a print background to help me transition, and a friend of mine who is from Brazil actually got a Brazilian mentor which was a huge help for her. Well, after completing the course, I began applying for UX jobs, and got an opportunity to interview with a eCommerce business for a junior position. Quite honestly, I felt well prepared for the interview and got advice from my mentor and other mentors throughout the process. I have now been at my current position for the past 10 months, and I know I have made the right decision. Thank you Springboard!Read Less",springboard
